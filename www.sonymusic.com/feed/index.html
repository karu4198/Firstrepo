<p><span class="xn-person">John Williams</span> and <span class="xn-person">Yo-Yo Ma</span> first met some four decades ago, when the Oscar-winning composer became conductor of the Boston Pops Orchestra and Ma was just beginning his remarkable solo career. Their creative collaboration has extended from the concert hall to the scoring stage to the 2008 inauguration of President <span class="xn-person">Barack Obama</span>, all anchored by an abiding personal connection and mutual regard. From their first encounters, each recognized in the other an understanding that, as Williams simply puts it, &#8220;music is our oxygen.&#8221;</p>
<p>The centerpiece of <i>A Gathering of Friends</i> is the first recording of Williams&#8217; newly revised version of his Cello Concerto, a work composed for Ma in 1994 and originally recorded for Sony Classical in 2001. As the four-movement concerto was performed over the last three decades, Williams made significant revisions to the score. Ma noted that the new version incorporates even &#8220;bigger changes, structural changes,&#8221; with a final movement that turns into &#8220;one glorious song, spinning and spinning, spinning to the very end.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also heard on <i>A Gathering of Friends</i> are new arrangements Williams created for Ma of three selections from his Oscar-winning score for <i>Schindler&#8217;s List</i> and a new arrangement for cello and strings of &#8220;With Malice Toward None&#8221; from his score for the 2012 film <i><span class="xn-location">Lincoln</span></i>. The album concludes with a duo arrangement for Ma and guitarist Pablo Sáinz-Villegas of &#8220;Prayer for Peace&#8221; from the 2005 film <i><span class="xn-location">Munich</span></i>. All three film scores are part of Williams&#8217; enduring partnership with director <span class="xn-person">Steven Spielberg</span>.</p>
<p>The other concert work on <i>A Gathering of Friends</i> – <i>Highwood&#8217;s Ghost </i>– reaffirms the Williams-Ma friendship in the context of the Tanglewood Music Festival and in the spirit of the legendary composer/conductor <span class="xn-person">Leonard Bernstein</span>. Williams composed the work to celebrate the Bernstein centennial at Tanglewood in the summer of 2018, evoking the legend of a ghost said to haunt the Highwood Manor House on the Tanglewood grounds – a ghost that Bernstein memorably encountered. Williams wrote haunting solo roles for Ma and the Boston Symphony Orchestra&#8217;s principal harp, <span class="xn-person">Jessica Zhou</span>, who reunite for this recording with the New York Philharmonic.</p>

<p><span class="xn-person">John Williams</span> and <span class="xn-person">Yo-Yo Ma</span> first met some four decades ago, when the Oscar-winning composer became conductor of the Boston Pops Orchestra and Ma was just beginning his remarkable solo career. Their creative collaboration has extended from the concert hall to the scoring stage to the 2008 inauguration of President <span class="xn-person">Barack Obama</span>, all anchored by an abiding personal connection and mutual regard. From their first encounters, each recognized in the other an understanding that, as Williams simply puts it, &#8220;music is our oxygen.&#8221;</p>
<p>The centerpiece of <i>A Gathering of Friends</i> is the first recording of Williams&#8217; newly revised version of his Cello Concerto, a work composed for Ma in 1994 and originally recorded for Sony Classical in 2001. As the four-movement concerto was performed over the last three decades, Williams made significant revisions to the score. Ma noted that the new version incorporates even &#8220;bigger changes, structural changes,&#8221; with a final movement that turns into &#8220;one glorious song, spinning and spinning, spinning to the very end.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also heard on <i>A Gathering of Friends</i> are new arrangements Williams created for Ma of three selections from his Oscar-winning score for <i>Schindler&#8217;s List</i> and a new arrangement for cello and strings of &#8220;With Malice Toward None&#8221; from his score for the 2012 film <i><span class="xn-location">Lincoln</span></i>. The album concludes with a duo arrangement for Ma and guitarist Pablo Sáinz-Villegas of &#8220;Prayer for Peace&#8221; from the 2005 film <i><span class="xn-location">Munich</span></i>. All three film scores are part of Williams&#8217; enduring partnership with director <span class="xn-person">Steven Spielberg</span>.</p>
<p>The other concert work on <i>A Gathering of Friends</i> – <i>Highwood&#8217;s Ghost </i>– reaffirms the Williams-Ma friendship in the context of the Tanglewood Music Festival and in the spirit of the legendary composer/conductor <span class="xn-person">Leonard Bernstein</span>. Williams composed the work to celebrate the Bernstein centennial at Tanglewood in the summer of 2018, evoking the legend of a ghost said to haunt the Highwood Manor House on the Tanglewood grounds – a ghost that Bernstein memorably encountered. Williams wrote haunting solo roles for Ma and the Boston Symphony Orchestra&#8217;s principal harp, <span class="xn-person">Jessica Zhou</span>, who reunite for this recording with the New York Philharmonic.</p>

<p><strong>Documentary Spotlighting the Groundbreaking Hip Hop Group Premieres Wednesday, April 20 at 8 PM ET/PT</strong></p>



<p><strong>Produced by Sony Music Entertainment and Mass Appeal</strong></p>



<p><strong>LOS ANGELES – March 31, 2022 –</strong> SHOWTIME has released the official trailer for<em> CYPRESS HILL: INSANE IN THE BRAIN</em>, which will premiere Wednesday, April 20 at 8 p.m. ET/PT. As part of the network’s <em>HIP HOP 50</em> banner, the documentary chronicles the legendary L.A. rap group and their decades-long career and influence.</p>



<p>To watch and share the trailer, visit <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezoTkEIivrY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>



<p>Told through the intimate lens of photographer and director Estevan Oriol (<em>LA Originals</em>), <em>CYPRESS HILL: INSANE IN THE BRAIN </em>is a smoke-filled journey across the lives and careers of the groundbreaking, genre-defying Hip Hop group, Cypress Hill. Their unique sound, influenced by their Latin roots and West Coast upbringing, was built on a movement rooted in true authenticity: From cultivating the flower, to smoking it, to rapping about it, their influence is forever burned into the musical landscape of Hip Hop as they continue to stay relevant after 30 years. Using a treasure trove of never-before-seen archival footage captured by Oriol himself, as well as images of band members B Real, DJ Muggs, Sen Dog and Eric “Bobo” Correa, <em>CYPRESS HILL: INSANE IN THE BRAIN</em> tells the story of a brotherhood that has withstood the test of time to create a truly original, everlasting legacy.</p>



<p><em>CYPRESS HILL: INSANE IN THE BRAIN</em> is produced by Sony Music Entertainment and Mass Appeal for SHOWTIME. Tom Mackay and Richard Story of Sony Music Entertainment, Sacha Jenkins and Peter Bittenbender of Mass Appeal, and Deb Klein of Primary Wave serve as executive producers. The film is produced by Oriol and Peter J. Scalettar. </p>



<p>The documentary film will debut along with two newly acquired <em>HIP HOP 50</em>  titles <em>LA MADRINA: THE SAVAGE LIFE OF LORINE PADILLA</em>, premiering Friday, April 15 at 8 p.m. ET/5 p.m. PT, and <em>BUSHWICK BILL: GETO BOY</em>, premiering Friday, April 29 at 8 p.m. ET/PT. <em>HIP HOP 50</em> will continue to run over the next two years and will encompass unscripted series and features, podcasts and digital shorts by and about some of the foremost names in the genre, culminating with the 50th anniversary of the genre in 2023. Previous titles include <em>YOU’RE WATCHING VIDEO MUSIC BOX</em>, <em>RICKY POWELL: THE INDIVIDUALIST</em> and <em>ROLLING LIKE THUNDER</em>. The initiative is driven by Nas and Mass Appeal Chief Creative Officer and Emmy® nominee Sacha Jenkins (<em>WU-TANG CLAN: OF MICS AND MEN, BITCHIN’: THE SOUND AND FURY OF RICK JAMES</em>).</p>

<p>This month, Sony Music Group embraced the official 2022 International Women’s Day campaign theme, #BreakTheBias, as we recognized and celebrated Women’s History Month and International Women’s Day throughout our organization.

<p>Below, read more about how Women’s History Month 2022 at SMG came to life!&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Creating the Women’s History Month Design</strong></p>



<p>First up: the color palette. We incorporated a range of purple hues into our Women’s History Month graphics as a nod to the official color of International Women’s Day—which historically signifies justice and dignity.</p>



<p>Next: the illustration. The shattering animation represents the ways in which women across the world are ‘Breaking Biases’, and continuing to shatter barriers in the pursuit of gender equity.</p>

<p><strong>Celebrating Women’s History Month at Sony Music Group</strong></p>



<p>Throughout the month of March, the Sony enterprise, including Sony Music Group, hosted internal events focused on empowering women and addressing stereotypes and discrimination.</p>



<p>Teammates from around the globe tuned in to a variety of programming spotlighting women leaders and their career journeys, the effect of gender bias, and improving allyship—particularly in the workplace. Listen to an International Women’s Day insight from <strong>Rachel Thomas</strong>, Chief Executive Officer &amp; Co-Founder, LeanIn.org &amp; OptionB.org: </p>

<p>In a conversation hosted by WIN (Women’s Initiative Network), Sony Masterworks artists, <strong>Chloe Flower</strong> and <strong>Uéle Lamore</strong>, shared their experiences as women creatives in the music industry. “There have been many different obstacles that I’ve faced as a woman in music,” said <strong>Lamore</strong>. “More is expected from you, like in the way you dress and talk. If you mess up, even a little bit, you will get judged.”</p>



<p>“Being the only woman in the studio can be uncomfortable, but we’re progressing,” <strong>Flower</strong> explains. “Seeing the growing number of women involved in the creative process has been great, but while it’s important to have women represented on stage, it’s equally important to have them at the executive level as well.”</p>



<p>A huge thank you to all the women—especially those who work outside of Sony Music Group—who lent their time and wisdom this Women’s History Month and International Women’s Day.</p>

<p>And a special shoutout to The Village, Wellful, Women’s Initiative Network (WIN) and SOMOS—Sony’s Talent Advisory Groups—for working closely with SMG’s Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion to coordinate several events in celebration of Women’s History Month!</p>



<p><strong>Moving Forward</strong></p>



<p>Although Women’s History Month 2022 has come to an end, Sony Music Group is committed to supporting and advancing women in the music industry and beyond.

<p><strong>Annual Philanthropic Program is Designed to Provide Resources, Exposure and Direct Access to Music Professionals, Creatives and Executives</strong></p>



<p><strong>Sony Music Latin Artist Lupita Infante to Lead Classroom Discussion for Los Angeles Unified Griffith STEAM Magnet Middle School</strong></p>



<p><strong>NEW YORK – March 28, 2022 –</strong> Sony Music Group (SMG) today announced the continued collaboration between nonprofit partners Save The Music and Music Forward for SMG’s second annual Beyond The Instrument program. Designed to promote creativity, education and career development in the music industry, Beyond The Instrument focuses on STEAM programming and collaborates with community partners to inspire personal development and prepare future music leaders.</p>



<p>This year’s 2022 program will take place on March 31 with participation from Sony Music Latin artist Lupita Infante and students from Los Angeles Unified Griffith STEAM Magnet Middle School (LAUSD). Sony Music Entertainment’s first event for the 2022 program will include a conversation with Infante led by artist, Nancy Sanchez, for students from the school to learn about Infante’s journey to becoming a hit singer-songwriter. The program will be followed by a four-week series of music industry education workshops led by Music Forward with students from the Save The Music program.</p>



<p>As one of the program ambassador’s this year, Latin Grammy® nominated artist Infante said, “I am very honored to be part of Sony Music’s Beyond The Instrument initiative and excited to share my experience within the beautiful world of music with the students. As a musician and performer, it is a privilege to help promote music education, and personally, working with LAUSD is very meaningful since my mom has worked with the district for over 30 years.”</p>



<p>When speaking of the ongoing partnership, Towalame Austin, Executive Vice President, Philanthropy and Social Impact, Sony Music Group said, “We’re honored to come together again with Music Forward and Save the Music to further develop music education programs and build opportunities for students in communities where STEAM education is underserved. Together with Lupita Infante, we look forward to proving these students with the resources they need and inspiring the next generation of music professionals.”</p>



<p>“I can’t wait to see and hear what happens when this group of students and these artists connect in the classroom,” said Save The Music’s Executive Director, Henry Donahue. “Los Angeles has such a rich cultural history of amazing music, and we’re fortunate to have Sony’s support to bring instruments, technology, and teacher support to Griffith – part of Save The Music’s drive to invest in more than 50 LA schools in the next few years.</p>



<p>“Music Forward is delighted to continue our partnership with Sony Music Group and Save The Music Foundation to help young people follow their dreams in music,” said Nurit Siegel Smith, Executive Director, Music Forward Foundation. “We’re thrilled to contribute our educational programs, workshops, and resources to inspire the next generation of artists, leaders, and innovators.”</p>



<p>“Arts and music education expands the cognitive, social and emotional development of young people while helping to cultivate critical thinking and problem-solving skills that are important for a well-rounded education,” said Los Angeles Unified Superintendent Alberto M. Carvalho. “Partnerships with groups like Sony Music Group, Save The Music and Music Forward offer Los Angeles Unified the opportunity to infuse music into our curriculum. I am grateful that leaders within the music industry are giving their time to inspire the next generation of musicians.”</p>



<p>Most recently, Beyond The Instrument launched a collaboration with Sony Music Publishing and nonprofit organization, Girls Make Beats, to empower the next generation of female music producers, DJs, and audio engineers, as a part of the program’s focus on songwriting and composing.</p>

<p><strong>New Southeast Asian Headquarters will be home to Sony Music Entertainment, Sony Music Publishing and The Orchard along with Sony Interactive Entertainment</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>The new investment will support thousands of Southeast Asian and international artists, cementing Sony Music Group’s long-term commitment to the region</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Singapore, March 23, 2022 </strong>– Sony Music Group (SMG) today announced the opening of its flagship headquarters for Southeast Asia, based in Singapore, which increases its investment and cements its long-term commitment to the region. </p>



<p>The new office will be home to SMG companies including Sony Music Entertainment (SME), Sony Music Publishing (SMP) and artist and label services company The Orchard, as well as serving as the new base for Sony Interactive Entertainment, creators of PlayStation. SMG’s new headquarters will house specialists in pan-regional marketing, data analytics, human resources, finance, digital innovation, business development, A&amp;R, and publicity, focused on Singapore and the wider region. Establishing the regional hub in Singapore will also allow SMG to leverage the talent pool and technology ecosystem in Singapore which is known as a leading hub for innovation and creativity. </p>



<p>“Asia is a diverse and vibrant region that has become a cultural force to reckon with, boasting some of the best talent and creators in the world,” said <strong>Shridhar Subramaniam, President, Corporate Strategy and Market Development, Asia and Middle East, Sony Music Entertainment</strong>. “Sony Music has a rich history of discovering and supporting some of the most iconic artists and impactful music originating from Asia, and it is fitting that Singapore, a technology, business and arts hub that’s long been considered a gateway to the rest of Asia, is the base for the next stage of our growth. Our new Southeast Asia headquarters will enable us to work more closely with our sister companies, blending innovation with entertainment to create even more benefits and opportunities for artists across the region”. </p>



<p>Singapore’s Minister of State for the Ministry of Trade and Industry and the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth, Alvin Tan was in attendance at the event, alongside Tse Yong Lim, Vice President, Singapore Economic Development Board. </p>



<p>“We are delighted with Sony Music Group’s decision to establish Singapore as its Southeast Asia headquarters,” said <strong>Mr. Lim Tse Yong, Vice President and Head, Capital Goods and Conglomerates, Singapore Economic Development Board</strong>. “This is testament to our continued attractiveness as a hub for companies to drive their business, innovation and talent objectives for the region. We look forward to the exciting offerings Sony Music Group will bring to its artists and audiences across Southeast Asia from Singapore.” </p>



<p>Also present at the opening were several senior leaders from SMG companies. Sony Music Publishing Asia provides best-in-class services on a regional scale to its songwriters and catalogues while also leading the industry with its high-level synchronisation operation and production music businesses. The Orchard also has made a significant impact in the growth of Asian music worldwide, working with artists to distribute their music to mainstream audiences, with a specialisation in digital channels. </p>



<p>“We are excited to have moved into this new office with the rest of Sony Music Group in Singapore”, said <strong>Carol Ng, President, Asia of Sony Music Publishing</strong>. “There is a richness of culture in Asia that has inspired countless songwriters spanning genres and generations. We are on the lookout for the next generation of Asian song-writing talent to enhance our existing roster, deliver new music to our audiences and take Asian music global.” </p>



<p>“The music scene in Asia is thriving,” added <strong>Priya Dewan VP, International Marketing, Asia Pacific and MD, Southeast Asia and Korea at The Orchard</strong>. “We always want to ensure that our labels and partners have access to the information, opportunities, platforms and services they need to grow their audiences in markets globally.” </p>



<p>At the official opening, Singaporean superstar Sezairi, who recently broke records in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia, with his hit song “It’s You”, alongside fellow Singaporean superstars Linying and Benjamin Khen, sang a medley of their hits in a pre-recorded performance for an audience including government representatives, dignitaries from the Southeast Asia entertainment industry and SMG’s leadership. They later surprised the audience by revealing themselves at the opening ceremony, much to their fans’ delight. </p>



<p>Sony Music Group is home to some of the most well-known artists and songwriters in Southeast Asia, including, Eric Chou, Sezairi, Tabitha Nauser, Gary Valenciano, Zee Avi, Dandy Hendstyo, Rhosy, Jason Chan, A-Teez, Ben&amp;Ben and Fatin, who work hand-in-hand with a wide network of producers, songwriters and other entertainment professionals to chart the direction of the Asian music scene.</p>

<p><strong><em>Power: Don King</em> Looks at the Extraordinary and Notorious Life of Famous Boxing Promoter Don King</strong></p>



<p><strong>The First Episode Is </strong><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/id1547265474" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Available Now</strong></a><strong>; Subscribe on Apple Podcasts</strong> <strong>For Exclusive Series “Power Plus: The Roundtable” </strong></p>



<p><strong>NEW YORK – March 14, 2022 – </strong>Somethin’ Else, a part of Sony Music Entertainment’s Global Podcast Division, today announced the premiere of its newest season of hit investigative podcast series <em>Power. </em>The new season, <em>Power: Don King</em>, explores the extraordinary life of legendary boxing promotor Don King, his drive to stay on top and his lasting imprint in sports and entertainment. The first episode is <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/id1547265474" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">available now</a>.</p>



<p>Hosted by author Panama Jackson, the cofounder of the award-winning <a href="https://www.theroot.com/very-smart-brothas" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>VerySmartBrothas.com</em></a> website and columnist at theGrio, the series will dive into the life of the bombastic boxing promoter, whose career highlights include the historic &#8220;The Rumble in the Jungle&#8221; and the &#8220;Thrilla in Manila&#8221; matches, and alliances with some of the biggest cultural icons outside of the ring, including Michael Jackson and The Jackson Family. The first episode features Don Elbaum, the boxing promoter who helped Don King get his start and King’s longtime attorney and friend, Clarence Rogers.</p>



<p>King has led a remarkable life, filled with defenders and detractors and the series will explore all aspects of his epic journey, from his formative years filled with adversity and crime to becoming the most successful boxing promoter the sport has ever seen, and the first Black man to achieve that status. While his larger-than-life appearance and commanding personality made him a star in and out of the ring, as did his promotion of greats like Muhammad Ali, Mike Tyson, Larry Holmes, Joe Frazier, King also faced accusations that his personal success was achieved by taking advantage of others. The series will feature new interviews with those closest to him, as well as cultural commentators who cover the cross section of race and culture in media.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Panama Jackson said, &#8220;Don King isn&#8217;t a complicated man. In reality, his goals were pretty simple: be the biggest, best promoter and showman ever and make A LOT of money doing it! To that end he was supremely successful. What is complicated though, is how that success—and the legacy built from it—looks in a historical context, which really depends on who you ask. He built an empire that made him rich but also made him look like a crook, but do you hate the player or hate the game? We&#8217;ll use this series to explore the nuance of that dichotomy; one that lives at the intersection of race, politics, sports and power resulting in Don King&#8217;s hold over boxing and culture in the 70s, 80s and 90s.&#8221;</p>



<p>Lizzie Jacobs and Tom Koenig are executive producers, Tiffany Walker is producer and associate producers are Kyre Assibey-Bonsu and India Witkin. Radio Rahim is consulting producer and Keith Romer is editor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last year,&nbsp;<em>Power: The Maxwells,</em>&nbsp;captivated listeners around the world, climbing the global Apple Podcast charts and reaching the #1 spot on UK and Canadian charts and #3 on U.S. charts in its debut week. The second installment of the series explored the complicated legacy of Playboy’s Hugh Hefner and made global headlines with exclusive conversations with former associates and playmates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Subscribe on Apple Podcasts to&nbsp;<em>Power Plus: The Roundtable</em>&nbsp;for exclusive access to ad-free episodes and a seat at the table each week as host Panama Jackson unpacks the drama from Don King&#8217;s life with his friends Jibri Griffin, Corey Wilson, and Tahira Henderson.</p>

<p><strong>This Season Follows the Children of Anonymous Sperm and&nbsp;Egg Donors as They Take on the Fertility Industry</strong></p>



<p><strong>Subscribe on Apple Podcasts for Ad-Free Episodes and Exclusive Bonus Series&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>New York, NY – March 9, 2022 –</strong>&nbsp;<em>BioHacked: Family Secrets</em>, the new podcast from Sony Music Entertainment’s Global Podcast Division, dives into the complexities of the fertility industry and chronicles how real people’s lives are transformed by evolving technology. Premiering today and hosted by journalist T.J. Raphael, season one follows the children of anonymous sperm and egg donors as they uncover the identities of their donors and gather vital medical information. Unexpected ethical, scientific, and political challenges arise that question all aspects of the baby business. The first two episodes are&nbsp;<a href="https://listen.sonymusic-podcasts.link/SCSC24867390?c=uwWFG9Ra8v5UZODm0vdVXQ&amp;h=d62e6fb80820d90ec" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">available now</a>.</p>



<p><em>BioHacked: Family Secrets</em>&nbsp;kicks off with the personal story of a woman who unintentionally found out&nbsp;she was born through an anonymous sperm donation after doing a DNA kit and discovering her half-sister. At age 30, she faced a complex mystery as she tried to track down her biological father for answers. This experience highlights how new technology disrupts the long-held secrets of the fertility industry and the challenges children of anonymous donors face searching for answers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“New technologies like 23 and Me and Ancestry.com are disrupting the baby business in ways that were never foreseen by doctors decades ago,” said host T.J. Raphael. “I look forward to sharing emotional stories that sit at the intersection of medicine and technology and show how the children of anonymous donors are navigating complicated family dynamics and political challenges as they take on the fertility industry.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Future episodes will focus on pioneering research into cryopreservation, a selective breeding experiment powered by a genius sperm bank, and the underground trade for sperm and eggs online.&nbsp;<em>BioHacked: Family Secrets</em>&nbsp;will also examine the story of the first IVF baby, and how commercial genetic testing&nbsp;kits now allow people to be their own DNA detectives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The series is produced by T.J. Raphael, Nick Mott, Shane McKeon, Jennifer Sigl and Khrista Rypl. It is edited by Maureen McMurray. </p>



<p>Listeners can follow the show on Apple Podcasts and all other major podcast platforms. Subscribers to&nbsp;<em>BioHacked Plus</em>&nbsp;on Apple Podcasts will be treated to ad-free episodes and the exclusive bonus series “DNA Reveal,” which explores other shocking stories of identity and DNA through someone’s real story of how commercial DNA kits impacted their lives.</p>

<p><strong>In celebration of Black History Month, Sony Music’s Global Podcast Division hosted a virtual panel about the importance of Black Representation in audio.</strong></p>



<p>This week, Sony Music’s <a href="https://www.sonymusic.com/podcasts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Global Podcast Division</a> hosted a conversation about the significance of Black representation in the growing podcasting industry.</p>



<p>The virtual panel,<em> “<strong>Passing the Mic: Black in Podcasting,”</strong></em> was developed and moderated by <strong>Janicia Francis</strong>, Creator/Producer, “<em>Tea with Queen and J.” </em>and Producer for season two of<em> “Good Words with Kirk Franklin,</em>” and featured a cross section of Black creatives working in audio, both in front of and behind the mic.</p>



<p>Panelists included <strong>Rob Dozier</strong>, Producer, Somethin’ Else; <strong>Sam Riddell</strong>, Lead Producer, “<em>In Those Genes”</em>; <strong>Catherine Saint Louis</strong>, Executive Editor, Neon Hum Media; <strong>Alzo Slade</strong>, Host, “<em>Cheat!” </em>and Vice News Correspondent; and <strong>Moses Soyoola</strong>, President of OTHERtone (Pharrell William’s podcast company).</p>



<p>There are inspiring moments and pieces of wisdom dropped throughout the conversation—here are just a few:</p>



<p><strong>Janicia Francis</strong><strong>: Moses, you are a podcast executive&#8230; I think a lot of us as creatives are often navigating how to make sure the ‘suits’ are happy, while still doing our creative work. Where does that merge with the creative side?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Moses Soyoola (</strong><a href="https://youtu.be/m4jjVux6fr8?t=511" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>8:31</strong></a><strong>): </strong>If you have that core thing that people are in love with, then the audience will come, the revenue will come, all the other things will come. For me it’s been exciting—it&#8217;s a different muscle to flex instead of trying to think of it from scratch as a money-making machine because when you do that, you almost end up at the place where everything sounds the same and that’s obviously what’s not going to benefit diversity in the space.</p>



<p><strong>JF</strong><strong>: Have you ever felt the need or temptation to code switch and not show up as your fullest self?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Catherine Saint Louis (</strong><a href="https://youtu.be/m4jjVux6fr8?t=1069" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>17:49</strong></a><strong>): </strong>I’ve always known who I am, I’m just becoming less afraid of speaking my mind…I think now, when I talk to some colleagues from NYT, they say something along the lines of “You used to be so nice, now you’re just so forward.” And it&#8217;s just so amazing to me because I guess I was hiding—there was some code switching going on. Or just some muting of myself. Now, at Neon Hum, I feel like I’m definitely bringing my full self.<strong> <u>(19:00)</u></strong></p>



<p><strong>JF</strong><strong>:Alzo, you wear so many different hats, from comedian to reporter to television. What would you say is something unique that you bring to podcasting—or a muscle—that you have to work when you are specifically creating audio?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Alzo Slade (</strong><a href="https://youtu.be/m4jjVux6fr8?t=2148" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>35:48</strong></a><strong>): </strong>I come to the podcast space from visual medium and performative medium; from stand up and even as a professor. One of the things that I really had to adjust: As a host, I didn’t realize I was so insecure about reading out loud—a full script. […] When I’m in the booth and I’m reading 16 to 20 pages, one of the challenges I recognized was you have to bring just as much juice at page 18 as you do to page five. When you’re reading for an hour or two, you can easily fall into this monotonal trap. […] What I bring to podcasting is that performative component but the challenge of transitioning that skillset to an audio medium is bringing the energy myself.</p>

<p>Last year at Sony Music Group, Black History Month centered education and reflection. This year, we were inspired to celebrate the Black community and the enormous cultural impact of Black creators and innovators across industries and around the world.</p>



<p>Below, read about how this year’s Black History Month theme came together, and the way Sony Music Group brought our celebration to life throughout February.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size" id="introducing-this-year-s-bhm-theme-the-roaring-20s-black-creativity-innovation-across-the-globe"><strong>Introducing This Year’s BHM Theme: “The Roaring 20s: Black Creativity &amp; Innovation Across the Globe”</strong></p>



<p>We&#8217;re in the midst of a new era of Roaring 20s, where Black creativity, entrepreneurs, creatives, and entertainers are driving society’s modern-day cultural renaissance. Organizations across the Sony enterprise and all Sony Music Group divisions (Sony Music Entertainment, Sony Music Publishing and The Orchard) embraced this theme <em>and </em>made it their own.</p>



<p>“I love this year&#8217;s Black History Month theme,” says <strong>Naledi Nyahuma Seck</strong>, Vice President of Diversity, Equity &amp; Inclusion at The Orchard. “When I think about the Roaring 20s, I think about the celebration of Black joy, Black excellence and Black existence. We are living, thriving and just simply, being. I am very proud of the way The Orchard honored this theme through our events produced by the U.S. and UK offices and our social campaign highlighting Black-owned businesses and creators.”</p>



<p>SMG’s Executive Vice President of Philanthropy and Social Justice, <strong>Towalame Austin</strong>, said the Roaring 20s theme inspired a sense of reflection: “This year&#8217;s theme inspired me to reflect on Black people&#8217;s history of influencing culture. Our community has driven societal change in education, music, and social impact (to name a few), and the past couple years’ events have been no different.&#8221;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>The Power of Design: Bringing SMG’s BHM Theme to Life</strong></p>



<p>Visually, the theme was brought to life with vibrant colors and photographs arranged in a quilt-like pattern, to symbolize the centering of community within Black culture and the intersectional layers of the Black experience and identity. From producing art to rallying in concert crowds, the photos reflect the idea of Black communities driving creative industries forward. Arranging these photographs in “‘22” speaks to the new era and decade, and emphasizes how Black communities, creatives, and innovators are quite literally shaping the future of culture.</p>



<p>Fun Fact: Josh Cheuse, Sony Music’s Corporate Communications Creative Director, captured the featured photos in the ‘80s. “When trying to embody Black creativity and innovation in the creative for Black History Month I thought of photographs I&#8217;d taken during the beginning of hip hop in the ‘80s and how people&#8217;s style was so original and music was incredibly innovative,” explains Cheuse. “Then I combined that with more recent images of activism in the BIPOC community and the new wave of creativity that has been made more accessible with new technology.&#8221;</p>

<p>We touched on topics from insights and experiences as Black creatives in podcasting, to the importance of buying from Black-owned and -led companies, to the ways in which Black creatives are making strides in technology, politics, and entertainment.</p>



<p>We’d like to give a special shoutout to all the folks who helped make Black History Month at Sony Music a true celebration of community, creativity, and innovation—especially the individuals who work outside of Sony Music and lent their time during these events:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Afika Nxumalo,</strong> Songwriter and Mixed Media Creative</li><li><strong>Amanda Ichite,</strong> Public Relations Manager at <a href="https://ainiorganix.com/">Aini Organix</a></li><li><strong>Brittney Winbush,</strong> Founder/CEO of <a href="https://alexandrawinbush.com/">Alexandra Winbush</a></li><li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/jayrellis/?hl=en"><strong>Jay Ellis</strong></a>, Actor, Writer, Producer and Director</li><li><strong>Jayson P.

<p>And, a big bouquet of roses goes to HUE (Helping Unite Everyone) U.S. and HUE Germany, a Talent Advisory Group at Sony, for spearheading several dynamic Black History events and serving as a consistent internal partner to SMG’s Office of Diversity, Equity &amp; Inclusion.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Looking Ahead</strong></p>



<p>As we wrap up Black History Month 2022, we are excited to be supporters—in big ways and small—in the continuation and preservation of Black creativity and innovation in music, movies, video games and more.</p>

<p><strong>Produced by Sony Music Entertainment and Mass Appeal,</strong> <strong>Documentary Spotlights The Groundbreaking Hip Hop Group’s Decades-Long Career and Influence</strong></p>



<p><strong><em>INSANE IN THE BRAIN </em>Joins Two Other New April HIP HOP 50 Titles <em>LA MADRINA: THE <s>SAVAGE</s> LIFE OF LORINE PADILLA</em></strong> <strong>And <em>BUSHWICK BILL: GETO BOY </em></strong></p>



<p><strong>LOS ANGELES – February 23, 2022</strong>&nbsp;<strong>–</strong>&nbsp;As part of the network’s&nbsp;<em>HIP HOP 50&nbsp;</em>banner, SHOWTIME announced&nbsp;that&nbsp;<em>CYPRESS HILL: INSANE IN THE BRAIN&nbsp;</em>(w/t)&nbsp;will premiere&nbsp;Wednesday, April 20 at 8 p.m. ET/PT. Chronicling the legendary L.A. rap group Cypress Hill, the documentary&nbsp;film&nbsp;will debut along with two newly acquired titles&nbsp;<em>LA MADRINA: THE&nbsp;</em><em><s>SAVAGE</s>&nbsp;LIFE OF LORINE PADILLA,&nbsp;</em>premiering<em>&nbsp;</em>Friday, April 15 at 8 p.m. ET, 5 p.m. PT, and&nbsp;<em>BUSHWICK BILL: GETO BOY,&nbsp;</em>premiering Friday, April 29 at 8 p.m. ET/PT.&nbsp;The announcement was made today at the network’s Television Critics Association’s Winter Press Tour presentation.</p>



<p>Told through the intimate lens of photographer and director Estevan Oriol (<em>LA Originals)</em>,&nbsp;<em>CYPRESS HILL:</em>&nbsp;<em>INSANE IN THE BRAIN</em>&nbsp;is a smoke-filled journey across the lives and careers of the groundbreaking, genre-defying Hip Hop group, Cypress Hill. Their unique sound, influenced by their Latin roots and West Coast upbringing, was built on a movement rooted in true authenticity: from cultivating the flower, to smoking it, to rapping about it, their influence is forever burned into the musical landscape of Hip Hop as they continue to stay relevant after 30 years. Using a treasure trove of never-before-seen archival footage captured by Oriol himself, as well as images of band members B Real, DJ Muggs, Sen Dog and Eric “Bobo” Correa,&nbsp;<em>CYPRESS HILL:</em>&nbsp;<em>INSANE IN THE BRAIN</em>&nbsp;tells the story of a brotherhood that has withstood the test of time to create a truly original, everlasting legacy.</p>



<p><em>CYPRESS HILL:</em>&nbsp;<em>INSANE IN THE BRAIN</em>&nbsp;is produced by Sony Music Entertainment and Mass Appeal for SHOWTIME. Tom Mackay and Richard Story of Sony Music Entertainment, Sacha Jenkins and Peter Bittenbender of Mass Appeal, and Deb Klein of Primary Wave serve as executive producers. The film is produced by Oriol and Peter J. Scalettar. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Directed by filmmaker and author Raquel Cepeda (<em>Some Girls</em>,&nbsp;<em>Bling: A Planet Rock</em>),&nbsp;<em>LA MADRINA: THE&nbsp;</em><em><s>SAVAGE</s></em><em>&nbsp;</em><em>LIFE OF LORINE PADILLA</em>&nbsp;follows a beloved South Bronx matriarch and former “First Lady” of the Savage Skulls gang as she struggles to remain visible in a rapidly gentrifying community she helped rebuild in the 1980s. With one foot firmly grounded in the outlaw life and the other as an activist and spiritual advisor, Lorine straddles the complexities of multiple worlds. Employing rich, never-before-seen archives of the borough that gifted the world both salsa and hip-hop culture, the documentary embarks on a complicated and, at times, surreal journey through five decades of Bronx history and resilience in La Madrina’s own words.&nbsp;<em>LA MADRINA</em>&nbsp;is executive produced by Henry Chalfant (<em>Style Wars</em>) and Sacha Jenkins.</p>



<p><em>BUSHWICK BILL: GETO BOY</em>&nbsp;chronicles the life of the late Richard Shaw, the Jamaican-American rapper and music producer professionally known as “Bushwick Bill,” an original member of iconic, pioneering Houston rap group The Geto Boys. From his early life in Jamaica to his rise to certified platinum record status, the documentary spotlights Shaw’s storied life and controversial career, including his near-death accidental shooting that left him blinded in one eye and his fight against music censorship.&nbsp;<em>BUSHWICK BILL: GETO BOY</em>&nbsp; is directed by Gregy Roman and produced by Memory &amp; Imagination’s Kyra Kowasic and Richard Shaw, in association with Like Studios executive producers Michele Fleischli and Aaron Sainz.</p>



<p><em>HIP HOP 50&nbsp;</em>will continue to run over the next two years and will encompass unscripted series and features, podcasts and digital shorts by and about some of the foremost names in the genre, culminating with the 50<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;anniversary of the genre in 2023. Previous titles include&nbsp;<em>YOU’RE WATCHING VIDEO MUSIC BOX, RICKY POWELL: THE INDIVIDUALIST</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>ROLLING LIKE THUNDER</em>. The initiative is driven by Nas and Mass Appeal Chief Creative Officer and Emmy-nominated partner Sacha Jenkins (<em>WU-TANG CLAN: OF MICS AND MEN, BITCHIN’: THE SOUND AND FURY OF RICK JAMES</em>).&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Organization Announces First-Ever Empathy Network Leadership Cohort&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>Supported by Sony Music Group and Van Jones&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Today,&nbsp;<strong>Dream Corps JUSTICE</strong>&nbsp;recognized that it received a $500,000 donation from the Sony Music Group Global Social Justice Fund. As a recipient, Dream Corps developed an advocacy training cohort program, spanning 17 states, and was based on teaching organizing tools that Dream Corps JUSTICE&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thedreamcorps.org/our-programs/justice/campaigns/first-step-act/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">used to lead passage of the First Step Act in 2018&nbsp;</a>and pass bipartisan criminal justice legislation in states across the country.</p>



<p>Within the program, twenty formerly incarcerated and justice-impacted individuals were given a six-month training program to develop organizing, legislative, campaign, and media literacy skills. As a result of the advocacy cohort, participants have already become nonprofit leaders, media spokespersons, and leaders of grassroots advocacy campaigns that reimagine justice, create alternatives to mass incarceration and make communities safer.</p>



<p>Additional milestones achieved as a result of the Sony Music Group donation include:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/inmates-justice-department-home-confinement-covid-pandemic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">5,000 incarcerated individuals on COVID-19 home confinement</a> from returning to federal prison</li><li>Restoring freedom and reuniting thousands of families impacted by incarceration under the <a href="https://www.thedreamcorps.org/our-programs/justice/campaigns/first-step-act/impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">First Step Act</a></li><li>Graduating formerly incarcerated individuals through mentorship and computer skills training and secure paid tech industry employment</li></ul>



<p>All of Dream Corps JUSTICE’s campaigns are led by people who have been impacted by the justice system and lived through criminal justice issues. Dream Corps operates on the belief that the people most harmed by our country’s legal system are uniquely qualified to create and champion the solutions that will begin to transform it.&nbsp; Dream Corp is launching a second year of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thedreamcorps.org/update/empathy-network-advocacy-cohort/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Empathy Network Advocacy Cohort</a>.&nbsp; Applications for 2022 open in March.</p>



<p>Today’s graduation (February 16, 2022) of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thedreamcorps.org/update/empathy-network-advocacy-cohort/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Empathy Network Advocacy Cohort</a>&nbsp;graduation will take place on Zoom at 7:00pm ET. Participants will be celebrated by friends and family members, along with Dream Corps founder Van Jones and leadership from Dream Corps and Sony Music Group.</p>



<p><strong>Van Jones, founder of Dream Corps, said:</strong>&nbsp;“America’s criminal justice costs too much, hurts too many, and doesn’t do enough to keep us safe. Fixing it is a mammoth task. To do it, we’ll need darers, dreamers, and doers. Sony Music Group dared to invest in formerly incarcerated people, Dream Corps dreamed of putting them at the center of solutions-based work, and today’s graduates stepped up to do the&nbsp;<strong>task</strong>. Now, thanks to this collaboration, they have the skills to equal their insight and are poised to help transform criminal justice in this country.”</p>



<p>“At Sony Music Group, we are committed to supporting efforts that drive social and racial justice initiatives around the world and are honored to partner with Van and Dream Corp JUSTICE to bring such an impactful and results-driven program to local communities,”&nbsp;<strong>said Towalame Austin, Executive Vice President of Philanthropy and Social Impact, Sony Music Group.</strong>&nbsp;“The program not only aligns with our criminal justice reform pillar from our<a href="https://giving-back.sonymusic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;Global Social Justice Fund</a>, but also allows us to connect with individuals who have turned their personal hardships into transformative and empowering opportunities.”</p>



<p>Detroit resident&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wxyz.com/news/detroit-man-wrongfully-convicted-of-double-murder-to-be-released-today" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kenneth Nixon</a>, a cohort member and President of the Organization of Exonerees, was recently exonerated after spending almost 16 years in prison for a crime that he did not commit.&nbsp;&#8220;I&#8217;m fresh out of a prison cell. I didn&#8217;t know anything about forming a nonprofit, sending out mass emails, or being able to collect data on your supporters. But learning it allowed me to take my organization to the next level,&#8221; he said. Just last month, Nixon formed a nonprofit organization to help other wrongly imprisoned people find freedom. &#8220;I would personally like to say thank you, Sony Music Group. The Organization of Exonerees wouldn&#8217;t be what it is without the training provided by this cohort.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today, as part of our Local Impact Reports series—which highlights Global Task Forces around the world that are working together to impact local communities with support from the Global Social Justice Fund (GSJF)—we connected with Bruna Araujo, People Experience Manager for SME Brazil to learn more about the team’s impact in the region.</p>



<p>For Araujo, getting involved with the task force was a very natural process. Since the start of the fund, “several initiatives and partnerships have been developed to promote social change,” said Araujo. “We live in a country that suffers from great social disparities and structural racism, where thousands of people are deprived of basic access – especially within the education and employment space. Therefore, when the GSJF was created, we were proud to expand on our efforts to help more local organizations have a lasting impact in our community.”</p>



<p>So where did the team start? Since the beginning of 2021, Araujo and the team worked closely with a consultant dedicated to Diversity, Equity &amp; Inclusion (DE&amp;I) to advance internal training programs including reviewing internal policies and furthering collaboration and partnerships with community organizations committed to ethnic-racial issues around the country. Externally, the team continues to work closely with <a href="https://www-redesdamare-org-br.translate.goog/?_x_tr_sl=pt&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=sc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Redes da Maré</a>, a local organization dedicated to developing programs to increase quality of life and protect civil rights for the population of Maré. In speaking with Joelma Souza, Head of Project Development Management, Redes da Maré, Sony Music’s support “enabled the purchase and delivery of 450 food baskets and personal hygiene kits to 450 families in Maré – directly to their homes – and continue to benefit nearly 1,4000 Maré residents.” Of the relationship, Araujo said “this is definitely one partnership that we are most proud of and hope to keep supporting even more in the coming years.”</p>



<p>As the team continues to work with the local community, their mission is to drive towards building a just society for all. “Our main goal now is to direct all future resources from the Global Social Justice Fund toward actions that not only promote financial support for education programs designed for historically marginalized communities, but also keep engaging SME employees to act as mentors for young people who wish to join the music industry. With constant support from the GSJF, we have the possibility to build projects that connect within our office and within our community. We’re excited for what is to come,” said Araujo.</p>

<p><strong>New York, NY – February 10, 2022 –&nbsp;</strong>Neon Hum, in partnership with Sony Music Entertainment, today announced the second season of its critically acclaimed podcast, “Spectacle” with the premiere of “Spectacle: Las Vegas,” a deep dive into what Sin City tells us about American culture. The 12-part series explores the cultural legacy and importance of the city on American society as it examines the complex ways in which Las Vegas became a place that explores people’s deepest desires. The first episode, which features a wide-ranging conversation with renowned Las Vegas magician Penn Jillette of “Penn &amp; Teller,” is&nbsp;<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/spectacle-las-vegas/id1551181322" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">available now</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a city that has defined popular culture, with its buzzing neon signs and world-class performers, Las Vegas attracts travelers to come to Sin City from around the world to explore their deepest desires through casinos, showgirls, and all you can eat buffets. Hosted by Las Vegas historian and artist Brent Holmes, “Spectacle: Las Vegas” dives deeper into the history of Las Vegas, exploring everything from shotgun weddings to the early days of the mob to the social engineering behind mega-casinos, as it dissects the critical moments that transformed the city into what it is today: an oasis in the desert.</p>



<p>“Las Vegas is more than an escape from reality; it’s a city on the cutting edge. Where Vegas goes, America follows,” said host Brent Holmes. “This city has been on the forefront of transgressive cultural shifts, beginning with legalized gambling and anti-prohibition drinking. We’re excited to share that trajectory with listeners and hold up Las Vegas as a window into American culture.”</p>



<p>“Spectacle: Las Vegas” is produced by Neon Hum. Joanna Clay is the Senior Producer, Catherine Saint Louis is the Executive Editor, Stephanie Serrano is Associate Editor, Navani Otero is the Associate Producer and Jonathan Hirsch is Executive Producer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In 2020, Sony Music Group (SMG) announced the creation of a $100 million Global Social Justice Fund (GSJF), dedicated to supporting social justice and anti-racist initiatives around the world. The GSJF’s mission is to meaningfully support well-established community organizations that directly impact vulnerable and historically excluded populations around the world. The fund’s portfolio, on track to connect with nearly 400 organizations, covers a variety of non-profit partners serving communities globally.</p>



<p>Towalame Austin, Executive Vice President of Philanthropy and Social Impact, alongside her team, has worked diligently since its inception nearly two years ago to drive the Fund forward and out into the world. Through both monetary and action-based programs, Austin and her team have developed authentic partnerships that have impacted communities worldwide.</p>



<p>We spoke to our SME Mexico Social Justice Fund Task Force to learn more about how they’re working with local communities and grassroots organizations to help tackle social injustice across the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jorge Luis Martinez, Director of People Experience (Human Resources), is responsible for attracting the best talent and helping them grow to be the future leaders of SME Mexico, and he also oversees social justice initiatives in the country.</p>



<p>“For many years, I have been interested in personally participating in community support programs,” says Martinez, when reflecting on first getting involved. “In fact, before I was in the HR department, I used to organize donations for poor, indigenous children on January 6 of each year. That is the Wise Men Day, where traditionally, children receive toys and blankets for the winter. After many years of searching for my personal purpose, I found that it’s to help people. It makes me deeply happy to actively participate in causes with a sense of social help.”</p>

				Jorge Luis Martinez, Director of People Experience (Human Resources)			</div>
				</div>



<p>What are the task force’s goals? Overall, they’re committed to action that ensures SMG supports society in Mexico in a sustainable way. “We seek how—through music—people can access a better world. For example, how music can help children in extreme poverty not to engage in activities that are harmful to society or help them grow as people and as good citizens,” said Martinez.</p>



<p>How does the task force collectively decide which organizations to partner with and donate to? It’s a careful and thoughtful process.</p>



<p>“In Mexico there is a lot of poverty and it is not difficult to find someone to help. There are so many organizations, the difficult thing is to choose which foundations to work with. A key focus for us is that the help reaches people in need directly, without intermediaries, and that the foundation is, of course, a legal foundation. We go directly to the locality where the donation is made to make sure that people in most need are receiving the help. In addition, this hands-on approach gives us huge satisfaction as we have the opportunity to spend time with people and learn from them, in the environment in which they live. Thanks to this, we’ve been fortunate to spend time to learn from a diverse range of those in need, including orphans, indigenous people, people with addictions or older adults, and others. It has been very gratifying for all of us involved in the Social Justice Fund,” said Martinez.</p>



<p>There is always more work to be done, but since the GSJF went live, SME Mexico has donated toys and blankets to indigenous children, supported the <a href="https://www.fondoguadalupemusalem.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fondo Guadalupe Musalem</a>, provided pantry donations to elderly communities, volunteered to restore forests, and more.</p>



<p>When speaking of the partnership, Rocio Blancas, Coordinator for <a href="https://www.fondoguadalupemusalem.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fondo Guadalupe Musalem</a> confirmed the funds from the Global Social Justice Fund allowed the organization to continue programs for young women from rural, indigenous or Afro-Mexican communities in Oaxaca. “In 2021, 271 scholars were able to continue their studies – including 50 young women to directly support their families and communities,” said Blancas. For scholars, this meant providing decent conditions for their stay with food supplies to allow for the further development of their studies.</p>



<p>Looking ahead, SME Mexico continues in its mission to drive social justice change. “We hope that the GSJF is valuable in empowering our employees to help our local community,” said Martinez. “We have high expectations that this will be an avalanche of good actions that will in turn lead to better ones, building a deep-rooted culture of responsibility and inclusion that benefits everyone.”</p>

<p><strong>New Season Follows the Shocking True Story of the “Bush Boys,” Two Teens Who Claimed They Were Raised in the British Columbia Wilderness</strong></p>



<p><strong>First Two Episodes Are&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/chameleon-wild-boys/id1532225667" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Available&nbsp;Now</strong></a></p>



<p><strong>Subscribe on Apple Podcasts for Special Access to Bonus Series ‘Art of the Con’</strong></p>



<p><strong>New York, NY – January 25, 2022 –</strong>&nbsp;Campside Media, in partnership with Sony Music Entertainment, today debuted the new season of hit investigative podcast series “Chameleon” with the premiere of “Chameleon: Wild Boys.” This season of the true crime series follows the shocking true story of two young men who emerged from the woods in a small Canadian town telling an incredible story: they’d been raised in an extremely remote cabin in the wilderness, and this was their first-ever contact with society &#8211; except nothing they said was true. The first two episodes are&nbsp;<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/chameleon-wild-boys/id1532225667" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">available now</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the “Chameleon” franchise continues to explore the art of scam artists, “Chameleon: Wild Boys” tells the story of a generous community who welcomed the ‘Bush Boys’ with open arms, only to find out the boys were not who they said they were. This season’s host, award-winning comedian and journalist Sam Mullins, gives a first-hand account of life in Vernon BC at the time that Kyle and Roen Horn claimed to be entering the modern world for the first time. “Wild Boys” will feature exclusive conversations with ‘Bush Boys’ themselves, their family, and members of the Vernon community.</p>



<p>“As someone who grew up in Vernon and experienced first-hand the outrageous ‘Bush Boys’ story, I’m looking forward to uncovering the bizarre true story of these two strangers who turned my hometown upside down,” said Sam Mullins. “This season of Chameleon will challenge the idea of what a con man is. Every time you think you have these boys figured out, they prove you wrong.”</p>



<p>Subscribe on Apple Podcasts for access to “Art of the Con,” a new exclusive talk show created by Campside co-founder and “Chameleon: Hollywood Con Queen” co-host Josh Dean and journalist Rajiv Golla, which dives into scams and cons ripped from the news – an idea that stemmed from the deluge of listener mail Dean received after “Hollywood Con Queen.” Subscribers can also listen to episodes of “Chameleon: Wild Boys” one week early and ad-free.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Chameleon: Wild Boys” is executive produced by Adam Hoff, Josh Dean, Matt Shaer, and Vanessa Grigoriadis at Campside Media.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em>Expansion of Six-Decade Relationship Between SME and Dylan Includes</em></strong> <strong><em>Extension of Recording Agreement And Rights to Multiple Future New Releases</em></strong></p>



<p><strong>NEW YORK, January 24, 2022 —</strong> Sony Music Entertainment (SME) today announced it has fully acquired Bob Dylan’s entire back catalog of recorded music, as well as the rights to multiple future new releases, in a major expansion of SME’s six-decade relationship with the artist.</p>



<p>This landmark agreement, concluded in July 2021, comprises the entirety of Bob Dylan’s recorded body of work since 1962, beginning with the artist’s self-titled debut album and continuing through 2020’s highly acclaimed and successful&nbsp;<em>Rough and Rowdy Ways</em>.</p>



<p>Bob Dylan and SME will continue to collaborate on a range of future catalog reissues in the artist’s renowned and top-selling&nbsp;<em>Bootleg Series</em>, which began in 1991 and includes 14 releases through last year’s lauded&nbsp;<em>Springtime In New York: The Bootleg Series Vol. 16 (1980-1985)</em>. The agreement also provides the opportunity for SME to partner with Dylan on additional projects.</p>



<p>This year marks the 60th anniversary of Bob Dylan’s singular recording career. He was signed to SME’s Columbia Records in October 1961 by the label’s John Hammond and recorded his debut album that same year. His&nbsp;<em>Bob Dylan</em>&nbsp;album marked the start of an unparalleled musical journey by a master of music who continues to have a profound and global impact on culture.</p>



<p><strong>Bob Dylan said</strong>, “Columbia Records and Rob Stringer have been nothing but good to me for many, many years and a whole lot of records. I’m glad that all my recordings can stay where they belong.”</p>



<p>In making the announcement,&nbsp;<strong>Rob Stringer, Chairman, Sony Music Group said</strong>, “Columbia Records has had a special relationship with Bob Dylan from the beginning of his career and we are tremendously proud and excited to be continuing to grow and evolve our ongoing 60-year partnership. Bob is one of music’s greatest icons and an artist of unrivaled genius. The essential impact he and his recordings continue to have on popular culture is second to none and we’re thrilled he will now be a permanent member of the Sony Music family. We are excited to work with Bob and his team to find new ways to make his music available to his many fans today and to future generations.”</p>



<p>Bob Dylan is one of our culture’s most influential and groundbreaking artists. In the decades since he first burst into the public’s consciousness via New York City’s Greenwich Village folk music scene in the early 1960s, Bob Dylan has sold more than 125 million records around the world and amassed a singular body of work that includes some of the greatest and most popular songs the world has ever known. He continues to traverse the globe each year, performing nearly 100 concerts annually in front of audiences who embrace his new music with the same fervor as they do his classics. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2016 – the first songwriter to receive such a distinction – cited by the Swedish Academy “for having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition.”</p>

<p><strong>Brad Scoffern, Ceremony of Roses Founder,&nbsp;<meta charset="utf-8">to Lead Enhanced Global Merchandising and Brand Management Operations</strong></p>



<p><strong>Agreement Combines Ceremony of Roses Roster, Including Adele, Olivia Rodrigo, A$AP Rocky, Baby Keem, Rex Orange County, Dominic Fike, and Cordae&nbsp;with Existing SME Merchandising Roster Including The Beatles, Camila Cabello, Jimi Hendrix, Maluma, Led Zeppelin, Lil Nas X, P!nk, Rosalia</strong></p>



<p><strong>NEW YORK — </strong>Sony Music Entertainment (SME) today announced the launch of a new global media, branding, design and events company through a strategic investment in <a href="http://ceremonyofroses.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ceremony of Roses</a> (CoR), a leading boutique merchandising company founded by music and fashion entrepreneur Brad Scoffern.</p>



<p>The new company will maintain the Ceremony of Roses brand and work with artists across the music and entertainment industry. The merchandise and branding company is already home to leading superstars including Adele, Olivia Rodrigo, A$AP Rocky, Baby Keem, Rex Orange County, Dominic Fike, Cordae, AG Club and more and will represent SME’s new flagship global merchandising arm, led by Scoffern and partner/Chief Business Officer Mary Healy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sony Music’s merch businesses around the globe will become part of the new Ceremony of Roses worldwide team. SME’s New York-based <a href="https://www.thethreadshop.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Thread Shop</a> division, which represents artists including The Beatles, Camila Cabello, Jimi Hendrix, Maluma, Led Zeppelin, Lil Nas X, P!nk, Rosalia and more, will remain as a brand under the Ceremony of Roses banner.</p>



<p>In making the announcement, Rob Stringer, Chairman, Sony Music Group, said, “Brad and his team at Ceremony of Roses have proven to be an incredibly creative force in developing futuristic branding and merchandising services for artists. We’ve been huge fans of his work with Golf Wang and what Ceremony of Roses has developed for its cutting edge roster of front-line talent. I look forward to joining forces to bring innovative ideas and concepts to our artists as extensions of their music talent.”</p>



<p><a></a>Said Scoffern, “I’m beyond excited and truly honored to be working with Rob Stringer and the entire Sony Music Team. I’m delighted to be working with a team that shares our artist-first approach in supporting creative talent. By joining Ceremony of Roses’ expertise in merchandising with SME’s global reach, roster and resources, we are set up for an exciting new chapter of growth. CoR was founded with the goal of enabling and expanding authentic fan/artist connections beyond a tour tee, and through working with incredible artists and mentors, especially Tyler, the Creator &amp; Christian Clancy, I have learned the value of fan engagement and the unique role merchandise and branding plays in this relationship. I look forward to helping the artists we work with build on the amazing advancements happening in the space today to deliver incredible experiences and products across all touchpoints with their fan base, regardless of where they are or how they buy.”</p>



<p>This new partnership further builds on Sony Music’s successful in-house merchandising business, and expands the scope and capabilities of its operations globally as part of the services and solutions it offers to the artist community. Together, the Ceremony of Roses and Thread Shop teams will jointly leverage their capabilities to drive new business opportunities around the world. The new company will focus on a broad range of artist merch and manufacturing efforts including the management and development of artist-backed brands such as Macklemore’s Bogey Boys and Kehlani’s TSNMI. Ceremony of Roses will also continue to support leading festival partners Golden Voice &amp; Live Nation and maintain a roster of management clients.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Founded in 2016 by Scoffern, Ceremony of Roses is a creative service agency built to solve the evolving commercial challenges of the world’s largest artists and live event producers. The firm specializes in developing cutting edge creative solutions and incubating talent-backed brands. The addition of Mary Healy in 2021 accelerated CoR’s commercial success and external partnerships, including a doubling of its staff and roster over the last 12 months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Prior to founding Ceremony of Roses, Scoffern was General Manager at 4Strikes management working under Christian and Kelly Clancy as part of their management team for Odd Future, Tyler, the Creator, and Mac Miller. In addition, while at 4Strikes he operated as one of the Camp Flog Gnaw Carnival Directors and General Manager of Tyler&#8217;s Golf Wang apparel brand, a position he still holds.</p>



<p>Before joining CoR, Healy served as the Senior Vice President of Strategy &amp; Growth at Scooter Braun Projects (SBP) where she led SBP’s Consumer Ventures team; a group responsible for developing talent-backed brands, including Justin Bieber’s Drewhouse. Prior to SBP, Healy spent 10 years at Google &amp; YouTube across a range of functions in the media and branded content space. </p>

<p>In this third interview in a series behind-the-scenes at Sony Music Group, Martin Staudigl, Vice President People Experience (HR) at Sony Entertainment in Germany, shares with Alan Hosking what is being done to eliminate bias in the hiring process.</p>



<p><strong><strong>Alan Hosking:&nbsp;</strong></strong>How have you been getting diverse employees on board at Sony Music without using bias in the selection process?</p>



<p><strong>Martin Staudigl: </strong>We launched a program this year which has a comprehensive selection method, and our approach was very different. We said to ourselves that we need more young, diverse people on board, and we want to give them a certain experience.</p>



<p>Sony has managers who have been with the company for many years, so we wanted to think out of the box. We promoted the programme through the national media. Our message was that we do not want a CV, we do not want a resumé and we do not even want your identity in the first stage of the process.</p>



<p>What we requested was a video or something creative, telling us why the applicant would want to work with Sony Music. We wanted them to tell us about their passion, their “idea”, what their contribution could be. The amazing thing is we got about 300 applications, which was a lot for us! And we were really very happy and surprised by how much creative input we received. We had established a website for applicants to upload their videos, and selection was only based on the creative input of these videos. We therefore didn’t know who was behind the scenes until later in the game, when applicants had to reveal their identities. So that’s how we managed to exclude initial bias!</p>



<p><strong>AH:</strong> What kind of people applied?</p>



<p><strong>MS:</strong> We received applications from people aged 50 and over, and from people all over the world. Originally, we had decided we wanted to fill two positions, but we increased that to three because we got so many good applications. After the initial video, the applicants had to do another comprehensive case study, which was also fun to do. It was in essence an online assessment.</p>



<p>From the group of applicants, we then selected one experienced male and we selected a very young, inexperienced female. The male applicant already had his own network of artists, which also helped as we didn’t have to get new artists on board for him. While the young female was very inexperienced, she had amazing passion.</p>

We reflect on the progress made while acknowledging the considerable work that remains as we strive for a more just and equal society.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This year, the King family is focusing on&nbsp;taking action to support voting rights legislation in the U.S. Their campaign concentrates on passing the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and Freedom to Vote Act.&nbsp;To support these efforts, SMG&nbsp;is making&nbsp;donations to the <a href="https://drummajorinst.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Drum Major Institute</a>, <a href="https://thekingcenter.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The King Center</a> and the <a href="https://www.civilrightsmuseum.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Civil Rights Museum</a>, all of which are directly connected to the King family and support their organization’s mission.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Through&nbsp;our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sonymusic.com/inside-sony-music/smg-global-social-justice-fund-fourth-round-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Global Social Justice Fund</a>, we’ve proudly supported civic participation and organizations leading the movement on U.S. voting reform. We’ve built meaningful partnerships with organizations like the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.apiavote.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">APIA Vote</a>, <a href="https://nbjc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Black Justice Coalition</a>, <a href="https://www.rockthevote.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rock the Vote</a>, <a href="https://votolatino.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Voto Latino</a>, <a href="https://whenweallvote.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">When We All Vote</a> and many more.</p>



<p>SMG proudly represents diverse voices, cultures and communities through our music and our creators. On Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day and every day, we continue to champion the core values we, and our artists and songwriters, believe in, and we will work to advance the efforts of Dr. King and the civil rights movement.</p>



<p>A list of educational resources were shared with U.S. employees to learn more about the life of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and his legacy.</p>

<p>This campaign represents the ongoing collaboration between Sony Music Group and Pay Away the Layaway to support local communities nationwide. “It’s amazingly impactful to partner with Sony Music Group to spread joy this way,” says Pay Away the Layaway Founder, Lee Karchawer. “They understand what it means to inspire hope and spread kindness in a meaningful way. The SMG artists we’ve worked with deeply care about their hometowns and communities, and it shows. We’re incredibly grateful for this partnership.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Nashville, SMG artists Matthew West and Zach Williams recorded videos to share with customers instead of appearing in-person in efforts to keep everybody safe and leave lasting memories for the customers to take home.</p>



<p>For Sony Music Group, Pay Away the Layaway and Burlington stores, the health and safety of all customers, staff, volunteers, artists and songwriters was of the highest importance. Volunteers and Burlington associates ensured all customers followed CDC guidelines and wore masks, socially distanced and remained diligent throughout the duration of the in-person events.</p>

<p><strong>Expands 40-plus Year Partnership Between Springsteen and Sony Music</strong></p>



<p><strong>Agreement Covers Entirety of Springsteen’s Legendary Recorded Music and Songwriting</strong></p>



<p><strong>NEW YORK – December 16, 2021 –</strong> Sony Music Group today announced it has acquired Bruce Springsteen’s entire recorded music and songwriting catalogs through separate agreements.</p>



<p>The two agreements cover the recorded music and music publishing rights to all of Springsteen’s songs, including “Born to Run,” “Born In The USA” “Dancing in the Dark” “Glory Days,” “The River,” “Hungry Heart,” “Brilliant Disguise” and “I’m On Fire,” among many others. Sony Music Publishing partnered with&nbsp;<a href="https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eldridge.com%2F&amp;data=04%7C01%7Cmiko.marfori%40sonymusic.com%7C77513aac2b0c4220af0c08d9c0e7706d%7Cf0aff3b791a54aaeaf71c63e1dda2049%7C0%7C0%7C637752922512628008%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&amp;sdata=iEo%2Bv23d8U9i4TLj2%2FjkhkouX%2BYxoAUqCRg9jSYBYzQ%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eldridge</a>&nbsp;on the songwriting catalog purchase.</p>



<p>Springsteen’s recording career with Columbia Records spans nearly 50 years and continues to this day, beginning with his signing in 1972 and his 1973 debut album &#8216;Greetings from Asbury Park, NJ.&#8217; Last year, he released &#8216;Letter to You,&#8217; his 20th studio album on Columbia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Said Springsteen: &#8220;I am one artist who can truly say that when I signed with Columbia Records in 1972, I came to the right place.&nbsp; During the last 50 years, the men and women of Sony Music have treated me with the greatest respect as an artist and as a person.&nbsp; I’m thrilled that my legacy will continue to be cared for by the Company and people I know and trust.&#8221;</p>



<p>A member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame, Bruce Springsteen has garnered 20 Grammys, won an Oscar and a Tony, been named MusiCares Person of the Year, received a Kennedy Center Honor and awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. He is the author of the 2016 best-selling memoir “Born to Run” (Simon &amp; Schuster) and creator of ‘Springsteen on Broadway,&#8217; which debuted in 2017 with a historic 236-show run at Jujamcyn’s Walter Kerr Theatre. Springsteen&#8217;s most recent studio album, 2020&#8217;s &#8216;Letter to You,&#8217; marked his first time recording live with the E Street Band in decades and debuted at #1 in eleven countries. His most recent tour with the E Street Band in 2016 was named that year&#8217;s top global tour by both Billboard and Pollstar. In 2021, Springsteen collaborated with President Barack Obama on the book and podcast Renegades: Born In The USA, reopened New York theaters with a reprisal of &#8216;Springsteen On Broadway&#8217; and shared his never-released &#8220;The Legendary 1979 No Nukes Concerts&#8221; film, distributed by Sony Music Entertainment&#8217;s Premium Content Division.</p>

<p><strong>Joint venture between Sony Music Entertainment Middle East and Anghami to provide creative home for Arabic artists of all genres and styles in Saudi Arabia, GCC and Levant</strong></p>



<p><strong>Wholly independent label to release music across all platforms in all formats</strong></p>



<p><strong>Former TikTok executive Rami Zeidan appointed General Manager to lead Vibe Music Arabia&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>December 15&nbsp;</strong>&#8211; Sony Music Entertainment Middle East (SME) and Anghami today announced the launch of “Vibe Music Arabia” – a new joint venture record label to support the independent Arabic artist community in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, wider GCC and Levant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Announced during the XP Music Conference by MDLBEAST in Riyadh, the wholly independent record label will act as a creative, accelerator and educational hub to empower musicians, songwriters, producers, and content creators to tell their stories regionally and globally. Aimed at showcasing the richness of Arabic music to a global audience, Vibe Music Arabia will strike the perfect balance between its global reach coupled with its deep regional insights to unleash the creative power of a new generation of Arabic artists. With original music at its core, all records will be released on all streaming platforms and services around the world to maximize reach and shine a spotlight on emerging music across the region.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Shridhar Subramaniam, President, Corporate Strategy and Market Development, Asia and Middle East, Sony Music Entertainment</strong>, said: “We are thrilled to announce the launch of Vibe Music Arabia as a new label for independent Arabic artists – combining Sony Music Entertainment’s unrivalled regional teams with dedicated resources and Anghami’s best-in-class services and technology, to help foster long-term partnerships and deliver global success for the next generation of Arabic artist talent. Vibe Music Arabia continues Sony Music Entertainment’s global focus and commitment to local language, domestic repertoire and communities. We believe the creative, community-first leadership team led by Rami and his team are perfectly placed to nurture and develop more artist stories and music and I wish him all the best as he leads this new, independent label in one of the fastest growing regions.”</p>



<p>Through Vibe Music Arabia, artists, songwriters, and producers will have access to a range of opportunities to build their brand and reach in the Middle East, as the new label combines Anghami’s unique local insights, rich data and networks with Sony Music Entertainment’s global reach and expertise.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“At Anghami we are proud of our deep-rooted Arabic origins,” added&nbsp;<strong>Eddy Maroun, Co-Founder and CEO of Anghami.</strong>&nbsp;“We see so many talented artists and songs emerge daily from this region and believe there is a real opportunity for a boutique label to foster these fast-growing music communities and help develop their craft. Now is the perfect time for Vibe Music Arabia.&nbsp;The team is young and passionate, with a wealth of experience and creativity that will unlock the potential in the Middle East, enrich the independent music scene and most importantly, create original tracks for the whole world to enjoy.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In one of its first moves, Vibe Music Arabia will be working with Khaleeji Producer AbdulAziz Louise, known for reshaping the sound of Khaleeji music through his latest productions for superstar Balqees on “Entaha”. His collaboration with Bader Al Shuaibi and Haneen al Kendari in “Bravo Aleih” achieved over 90 million views across platforms, and over 200 million streams overall.&nbsp;&nbsp;Known for her mesmerizing voice, famous medleys and over a million followers on Instagram, rising Saudi talent Zena Emad will also be joining Vibe Music Arabia to work on her upcoming single, taking her career to new heights.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bringing more than 15 years’ experience in cultural marketing, music, and entertainment, most recently as the head of TikTok MENA’s Video and Creative division,&nbsp;<strong>Rami Zeidan</strong>&nbsp;will be leading&nbsp;<strong>Vibe Music Arabia as General Manager.</strong>&nbsp;Commenting on the launch, he said: “At Vibe, our approach is simple- to be a creative and enabling hub, and to build a dialogue within the community to teach, learn and help young talent grow. I am feeling super inspired by the region’s enabling ecosystem and the young talent that is coming from every corner. With the impact of digital streaming on the rise, our commitment is to foster this talent, and work hand in hand towards shaping a new era for Arabic music.”</p>

<p><strong>Award to be presented at Clive Davis&#8217; and the Recording Academy<meta charset="utf-8">®&#8217;s Pre-Grammy<meta charset="utf-8">® Gala</strong></p>



<p><strong>The Annual Grammy<meta charset="utf-8">® Week Event Returns to the Beverly Hilton on Sun, Jan. 30, 2022</strong></p>



<p><strong>SANTA MONICA, CALIF. (DEC. 15, 2021) —</strong> The Recording Academy® today announced Sony Music Group Chairman, Rob Stringer, will receive the 2022 GRAMMY Salute To Industry Icons® award for his leadership, impact and dedication to advancing innovation in the music industry. Stringer will be celebrated at Clive Davis&#8217; and the Recording Academy®&#8217;s Pre-GRAMMY® Gala returning to the Beverly Hilton, in person, on Sun, Jan. 30, 2022, the evening preceding the 64th Annual GRAMMY Awards®.</p>



<p>&#8220;Rob has been one of the most influential leaders in our industry for decades,&#8221; said Harvey Mason jr., CEO of the Recording Academy. &#8220;His work in building a more inclusive culture in music and his love for real artists have been game changing. From introducing the world to so many talented artists to always putting them first, with initiatives like Artists Forward and Songwriters Forward, Rob&#8217;s impact is massive. We take great pleasure in honoring him and his groundbreaking contributions to the music community at the 2022 Pre-GRAMMY Gala.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;A music man to his core, Rob Stringer is an innovator, a pioneer and a true champion for artists,&#8221; said Davis.&nbsp; &#8220;He has been at the front line of change in the music industry for decades, advancing social justice and tolerance, developing major global artists, all while spearheading hit after hit after hit. The night of the Pre-GRAMMY Gala is a night that celebrates music and it is also a night that celebrates that person who has uniquely contributed to the health of the music industry and to music itself. That person, this year, is most deservedly Rob Stringer.&#8221;</p>



<p>Stringer has been Chairman of Sony Music Group since 2019 after being appointed CEO of Sony Music Entertainment in 2016. He is responsible for leading the global strategies and activities of the world&#8217;s largest music publishing company and second largest recorded music company.</p>



<p>Within Sony Music, Stringer has continued expanding and evolving the company&#8217;s approach to artist development and breaking hits globally. In 2021, he implemented the unprecedented programs Artists Forward and Songwriters Forward to create more earnings opportunities for artists and songwriters. The programs also prioritize health and wellness support for creators around the world.</p>



<p>In 2020, he was instrumental in the launch of Sony Corp&#8217;s $100 million Social Justice Fund to support social justice and anti-racist initiatives around the world.</p>



<p>Stringer started his career at CBS Records in 1985 and rose within the company to become managing director of Epic Records in 1992 and chairman of Sony Music UK in 2001. When Sony Music entered into a joint venture with BMG in 2004, Stringer became chairman of Sony BMG Music UK. He was promoted to chairman of the U.S.-based Sony Music Label Group in 2006, and when Sony Corp. acquired BMG&#8217;s half of the joint venture in 2008, he was appointed chairman of Sony Music Entertainment&#8217;s Columbia Records.</p>



<p>Over the course of his career with Sony Music, Stringer has worked with global superstars including AC/DC, Adele, Barbra Streisand, Beyoncé, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Celine Dion, the Clash, Daft Punk, David Bowie, Depeche Mode, George Michael, Harry Styles, Jack White, John Legend, John Mayer, Michael Jackson, Pharrell Williams, Pink, Sade, Tony Bennett and Tyler, The Creator.&nbsp; In addition, he has led successful collaborations between the worlds of music, television and film, and Stringer drives the continued development of digital and interactive content strategies and platforms.</p>



<p>Stringer joins a prominent list of previous honorees, including Sean &#8220;Diddy&#8221; Combs, Herb Alpert &amp; Jerry Moss, Clarence Avant, Irving Azoff, Martin Bandier, Sir Richard Branson, Shawn &#8220;JAY-Z&#8221; Carter, Clive Davis, Ahmet Ertegun, David Geffen, Berry Gordy, Lucian Grainge, Debra L. Lee, Doug Morris, Mo Ostin, and Antonio &#8220;L.A.&#8221; Reid.</p>



<p>For the past decade, the invitation-only Pre-GRAMMY Gala includes a presentation to honor industry luminaries through the Recording Academy&#8217;s GRAMMY Salute To Industry Icons award. Sponsored by Hilton, IBM, JBL, and MasterCard, the night has become one of the music industry&#8217;s most distinguished events convening music&#8217;s most innovative and influential creators and professionals.</p>

<p><strong>Aspiring Storytellers from Historically Excluded Groups Encouraged to </strong><a href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/editorbootcamp/jobs/5758044002" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Apply Beginning Today</strong></a></p>



<p><strong>Neon Hum to Offer Staff Editor Position to One Graduate at Conclusion of Course</strong></p>



<p><strong>NEW YORK AND LOS ANGELES – December 15, 2021</strong> – Neon Hum Media, in partnership with Sony Music Entertainment, today announced the launch of its second annual free Editors’ Bootcamp, which will begin accepting applications starting today.</p>



<p>Created as a free podcast training bootcamp for aspiring podcast editors from historically excluded groups, the eight-week course led by Neon Hum’s Executive Editor Catherine Saint Louis is designed to provide an opportunity for Black and Indigenous storytellers, the LGBTQ, Latino, AAPI, people with disabilities and all communities of color, to help drive their rarely heard, yet critical, stories in podcasting. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The eight people selected for this year’s course will learn and develop relevant skillsets from some of the industry’s top editors and experts. At the conclusion of the course, one graduate will be offered a staff editor position at Neon Hum. The program is designed to develop the selected students into top candidates for employers to also consider hiring as editors after graduation.</p>



<p>The eight prospective editors for this year’s bootcamp will be announced in early 2022 and the course will run from mid-March to mid-May 2022. The application portal for prospective editors is <a href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/editorbootcamp/jobs/5758044002" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open now</a> through January 21.</p>



<p>The first bootcamp series in 2021 received an overwhelming response with more than 250 applications from longtime producers, print reporters and editors, documentary filmmakers and people in public radio interested in switching to narrative podcasts. After participating in the course, Nevada based journalist Stephanie Serrano joined Neon Hum as a staff editor in June and has worked on several top series for the Company, including <em>Smoke Screen: The Sellout</em> and the upcoming season of <em>Spectacle</em>. Other graduates of last year’s program went on to work on hit shows across the industry, including Snap Judgment’s<em> Spooked </em>and Virginia Public Media’s <em>Seizing Freedom</em>.</p>



<p>Catherine Saint Louis said, “The audio industry still lacks representation from so many groups and voices, so we are thrilled to be bringing back the Bootcamp for another year and creating a way for people to become story editors.” She added, “It’s free and an incredible opportunity to learn from peers as well as the industry’s top editors. And at the end of it all, one lucky graduate will get a full-time job working at Neon Hum.”</p>



<p>Funding for the bootcamp is made possible by Sony Music Entertainment. To learn more about Sony Music’s commitment to supporting communities globally and locally, <a href="https://giving-back.sonymusic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">click here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Human Re Sources to Become Part of The Orchard</strong></p>



<p><strong>J. Erving Will Take on Newly Created Role of Executive Vice President, Creative Development, Sony Music Entertainment</strong></p>



<p><strong>(New York, NY – DECEMBER 4, 2020) –</strong> Sony Music Entertainment (SME) today announced the acquisition of top LA-based artist distribution and services company Human Re Sources from Q&amp;A. It will become part of The Orchard, SME’s global independent music distribution and artist and label services company. Based in Los Angeles and led by J. Erving, Human Re Sources will continue to sign and develop artists directly as part of The Orchard’s comprehensive suite of global offerings and tools to artists and record labels.</p>



<p>Additionally, J. Erving will become Executive Vice President, Creative Development for Sony Music Entertainment. In this newly created role, he will report to Rob Stringer, Chairman, Sony Music Group and work closely with SME’s recorded music teams. He will serve as a resource for the Company’s artists and labels on various projects providing his exclusive artist development and A&amp;R producing expertise.</p>



<p>In his capacity continuing to lead Human Re Sources, he will also become an Executive Vice President at The Orchard reporting to Brad Navin, CEO of The Orchard. Under Erving’s leadership, Human Re Sources signed and developed artists such as YBN Nahmir, Pink Sweat$, Baby Rose, Bren Joy and more, whose music has garnered more than 2.5 billion streams since the company was founded. With a track record of success, Human Re Sources will bring artists 2Tone and Grip as well as Grammy-nominated Ant Clemons to The Orchard.</p>



<p>Previously, Human Re Sources was part of Q&amp;A, a modern music and technology company co-founded and launched in 2019 by Troy Carter, Suzy Ryoo and J. Erving.</p>



<p>In making the announcement, Stringer said, “J has consistently managed to combine a natural A&amp;R background with futuristic entrepreneurial flair. We have wanted to work with him for a long time so we are excited to have his label and expertise at The Orchard and a wider role within the core Sony Music company as a double step forward together.”</p>



<p>Erving said, “Since founding the company in 2017, I’ve made it my mission to seek quality over quantity, thereby establishing Human Re Sources as a formidable independent powerhouse of talent development. I am proud of what we’ve built and look forward to continuing to sign artists we truly care about in conjunction with our new partners at The Orchard. Our goal from the onset was to move culture. This partnership is a win for the culture. I am looking forward to this next chapter.”</p>



<p>“The Orchard empowers entrepreneurs as well as artists,” said Navin. “Partnering with J and the Human Re Sources team allows us to leverage both companies&#8217; strengths as powerhouses to foster the development of great artists and deliver their music to a global audience.”</p>



<p>“Today marks another bittersweet and historic moment in my 21-year friendship and partnership with J Erving,” said Q&amp;A CEO Troy Carter. “Brad Navin and Rob Stringer’s passion for the Human Re Sources roster made it the right home for the future of the brand. The HRS team will forever be a part of the Q&amp;A family.”</p>

<p><strong>&#8220;Mariah&#8217;s Christmas: The Magic Continues</strong><strong>&#8221; Premiering Globally Today on Apple TV+</strong></p>



<p><strong>New York, NY – December 3, 2021 &#8211;</strong> Mariah Carey&#8217;s &#8220;All I Want for Christmas is You&#8221; continues to make pop music history this year as the artist&#8217;s perennial yuletide standard (cowritten and coproduced by Mariah Carey and Walter Afanasieff in 1994) keeps breaking new records while lighting up the 2021 holiday season.</p>



<p>This December, &#8220;All I Want for Christmas is You&#8221; became the first and only holiday single to take home the RIAA&#8217;s coveted Diamond Award (in recognition of ten million sales and streaming units in the United States).</p>



<p>Listen to Mariah Carey’s “All I Want For Christmas is You” <a href="https://mariahcarey.lnk.to/Christmas" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;The continued love for my song never ceases to amaze me and fill my heart with a multitude of emotions,&#8221; said Mariah. &#8220;It blows my mind that &#8216;All I Want for Christmas is You&#8217; has&nbsp;endured different eras of the music industry. The RIAA DIAMOND award?!&nbsp;Wowww!&nbsp;I&#8217;m so fortunate to have the greatest fans on Earth, my Lambily, who continue to support my legacy. I love you.&#8221;</p>



<p>“Mariah is the Queen of Christmas,” said President of the Commercial Music Group at Sony Music Entertainment, Richard Story. “Her Sony Music family congratulates her on breaking yet another record, and continuing to make history as the first and only artist to achieve this incredible milestone.”</p>



<p>“Mariah Carey is one of the top Gold &amp; Platinum awarded artists of all time, and ‘All I Want For Christmas Is You’ becoming the only holiday song to achieve Diamond is a remarkable milestone forever etched in music history.&nbsp; Congratulations and happy holidays to Mariah and her amazing Sony team,” said Mitch Glazier, Chairman and CEO, RIAA.</p>



<p>Carey&nbsp;also&nbsp;spotlights&nbsp;the global fan-favorite &#8220;All I&nbsp;Want for&nbsp;Christmas is You&#8221; in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Apple TV+ smash-hit,&nbsp;<em>Mariah Carey’s Magical Christmas Special</em>, with a show-stopping performance of the record-breaking song, along&nbsp;with her twins, son Moroccan and daughter Monroe.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the heels of this exciting news, Carey&nbsp;debuts her all-new&nbsp;holiday&nbsp;extravaganza&nbsp;<em>Mariah’s Christmas: The&nbsp;Magic&nbsp;Continues</em>, premiering globally today and&nbsp;available now on Apple TV+.</p>



<p>On Tuesday, December 7, Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE) will make two Mariah Carey films, <strong><em><u>Live at the Tokyo Dome</u></em></strong> and <strong><em><u>First Vision</u></em></strong>, available for digital purchase and rental for the first time in the United States. Showcasing more than 80 minutes of music, including a stunning live version of &#8220;All I Want for Christmas is You,&#8221; <strong><em><u>Mariah Carey: Live at the Tokyo Dome</u></em></strong> captures the artist&#8217;s historic first concert in Japan, lensed during her 1996 Daydream World Tour. <strong><em><u>Mariah Carey: First Vision</u></em></strong> gives viewers an inside look at Mariah on the cusp of her meteoric rise to superstardom; this 1991 film contains early music videos, behind-the-scenes footage, an interview and songs from her very first live performance at New York&#8217;s intimate Tatou Club in 1990. Currently available in the US only, four additional Mariah Carey films&#8211;<em><u>Fantasy: Mariah Carey at Madison Square Garden</u></em>, <em><u>Here is Mariah Carey</u></em>, <em><u>Mariah Carey Around the World</u></em> and <em><u>Mariah Carey: MTV Unplugged +3</u></em>&#8211;will be released worldwide via SPE on December 7.</p>



<p>Billboard recently named Mariah Carey&#8217;s &#8220;All I Want for Christmas is You&#8221; as the #1 record on their <a href="https://www.billboard.com/charts/greatest-of-all-time-holiday-100-songs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Greatest of All Time Holiday 100&nbsp;Songs</a> list. The song first cracked the Top 10 of the Hot 100 in December 2017 and, in December 2019, 25 years after its original release, became the second holiday single ever to hit #1 on the Hot 100, breaking the record for longest span from release date to #1. &#8220;All I Want for Christmas is You&#8221; hit #1 again in 2020, giving it a five week total in the top slot, a new milestone for a holiday recording.</p>



<p>Recorded in August 1994 at The Hit Factory in New York, &#8220;All I Want for Christmas is You&#8221; was originally released in October 1994 as the first single from Mariah&#8217;s <em><u>Merry Christmas</u></em> album, a showcase for Mariah&#8217;s interpretations of familiar holiday songs alongside the new material she&#8217;d composed with co-writer Walter Walter Afanasieff. &#8220;All I Want for Christmas Is You&#8221; went on to become one of the best-selling singles (of any genre) of all time and the best-selling holiday ringtone in the United States for several years running.</p>



<p>When &#8220;All I Want for Christmas is You&#8221; hit #1 on the Hot 100 in 2019, it was Mariah&#8217;s 19th claim on the top spot, a record for a solo recording artist; when her holiday single hit #1 the following year, Mariah became the first artist to have a Hot 100 # 1 in four separate decades (the 1990s, the 2000s, the 2010s and the 2020s).</p>



<p>Having charted every holiday season since its original release, Mariah Carey&#8217;s &#8220;All I Want for Christmas is You&#8221;&#8211;which The New Yorker called &#8220;one of the few worthy modern additions to the holiday canon&#8221;&#8211;has become an essential seasonal standard that continues to bring the spirit of Christmas to the hearts of music lovers the world over.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;All I Want for Christmas is You&#8221; is Carey&#8217;s biggest international success, topping the charts in twenty-six countries including Australia, Canada, France and Germany. In 2020, the holiday classic topped the charts in the United Kingdom for the first time, spending a record 69 weeks in the UK Top 40 before reaching #1. &#8220;All I Want for Christmas is You&#8221; is the all-time best-selling Christmas single by a female artist and one of the top-selling physical singles in music history. It&#8217;s the first holiday ringtone to be certified double platinum by the RIAA.</p>

<p>Sony Music Group’s commitment to corporate giving is at the heart of our philanthropic programs and activities across the globe – from the programs led by our businesses to the partnerships we forge with artists, songwriters, and other creators.</p>



<p>We’ve taken action and provided funding to support communities that need it most, inside and outside the music industry. Now, the Sony Music Group Global Social Justice Fund is on track to connect with nearly 400 community partners around the world. Together with these groups, we aim to help advance bipartisan solutions in the areas of civic engagement, criminal justice reform, and education. You can see our full list of partners <a href="https://giving-back.sonymusic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>



<p>And that list is about to grow—because today, we’re excited to share the news that we’ve started outreach to organizations for the&nbsp;<strong>fourth</strong>&nbsp;round of funding from the Sony Music Group Global Social Justice Fund.&nbsp;Our global task force leaders and their teams are hard at work determining the next pool of community partners to receive support.</p>



<p>We are eager to work in collaboration with more nonpartisan groups whose efforts align with our three giving pillars. Whether we’re supporting new community organizations or recommitting to existing nonprofits, our goal is the same: to empower our employees to make change happen—locally and abroad.</p>



<p>You’ll hear more from us about the new round of funding in the coming months.</p>



<p>In the meantime, we’re excited to separately kick off&nbsp;<strong>this year’s Season of Giving campaign, which begins next week on Giving Tuesday</strong>.</p>



<p>Thank you for all that you do to serve our communities in need around the world.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Journalist and Executive Producer Bijan Stephen Hosts New Podcast Series That Examines the Most Explosive Stories You Never Knew</strong></p>



<p><strong>The First Episode Is <u><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/eclipsed/id1587958685" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Available Now</a></u></strong></p>



<p><strong>New York, NY – November 16, 2021 –</strong> Campside Media, in partnership with Sony Music Entertainment, today announced the launch of <em>Eclipsed</em>, a new narrative history podcast that dives into the fascinating stories hidden in the shadows of history. Hosted by journalist and executive producer Bijan Stephen, <em>Eclipsed</em> is a show about events most people have forgotten — or maybe never even knew about to begin with — and features original reporting with eyewitnesses from the time.</p>



<p>The first three episodes dive into the story of an up-and-coming Australian pop star in the 1960s, Cathy Wayne, who was tragically shot and killed on stage while playing a set for American Marines at Da Nang during the Vietnam War. The murder of an Australian woman on an American base would have been world news, except that it happened on July 20, 1969 —&nbsp;the day of the moon landing. By interviewing some of the biggest names in Australian entertainment at the time, Stephen explores how Wayne ended up on that fateful stage and why most people never knew about it.</p>



<p>The series also spotlights a disappearing lake in Louisiana, the two brothers whose obsession with precious metal nearly crashed the global economy, and the three Americans who went to the Moscow Olympics in defiance of Jimmy Carter’s boycott.</p>



<p>“I’m excited and honored to be able to host a show like this one, where we get to take our listeners on some incredible narrative journeys,” said host and executive producer Bijan Stephen. “We’ve got a lot of really cool stories coming up. Tune in! I mean, what could it hurt?”</p>



<p>The series is hosted and executive produced by writer Bijan Stephen (<em>The Verge, The Believer</em>), and written and executive produced by narrative journalist Michael Canyon Meyer (<em>American Scandal, Business Wars</em>) for Campside Media.</p>

<p>In the first of a new behind-the-scenes interview series with Sony Music Group, <em>HR Future</em> magazine profiles Claude Monnier, HR Director of Sony Music France in Paris. Monnier talks in detail about how Sony Music France is bringing diversity to the music industry through its wildly popular, nationwide A&amp;R recruitment campaign. </p>



<p>In the interview, Monnier discusses the importance of diverse talent and teams and how those values are reflected in Sony Music Talent Factory—a nationwide A&amp;R recruitment campaign encouraging people across the country from a variety of diverse backgrounds to apply for a position at Sony Music. The campaign gave people a glimpse into the life of an A&amp;R and the value and passion these roles bring to artists, resulting in 60,000 video applications.</p>



<p>&#8220;We wanted to build a bigger pipeline of people who are open and attracted to working in the music business, by encouraging and growing their curiosity and passion for music,&#8221; states Monnier. “At the end of the day, our aim is to develop artists’ careers and, to do that, we need creative people who can relate to, and best help, our artists find success. So, we knew we needed to think differently about how to build a pipeline of France’s future A&amp;R leaders.”</p>



<p>Monnier goes on to describe the inspiration behind the Sony Music Talent Factory recruiting idea, and what the most important takeaways have been.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em>Power: Hugh Hefner</em></strong><strong> Dives into the Complicated Legacy of Hugh Hefner and Playboy Through Conversations with Playmates, Including Holly Madison</strong></p>



<p><strong>The First Episode Is </strong><a href="https://link.chtbl.com/PowerHefner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Available Now</strong></a><strong>; Subscribe on Apple Podcasts for <em>The Bunny Tapes</em>, Which Includes Ad-Free Episodes &amp; Weekly Bonus Episodes</strong></p>



<p><strong>NEW YORK AND LONDON – November 1, 2021 – </strong>Somethin’ Else, in partnership with Sony Music Entertainment, today announced the premiere of its newest season of the hit investigative podcast series <em>Power. </em>The season explores the complex story behind legendary Playboy founder Hugh Hefner’s rise and the legacy he left behind, told through the eyes of the women who knew him best. The first episode is <a href="https://link.chtbl.com/PowerHefner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">available now</a>.</p>



<p>Hosted by journalist and author Amy Rose Spiegel, the series will delve into Hefner’s rise to power and the origins of Playboy and investigate questions around the dark side of the brand, including notorious Mansion parties and Hefner’s manipulation and control of his girlfriends and other associates. Featuring conversations with several of the women directly involved with Playboy, including Bunnies who worked in the clubs and the model and TV personality Holly Madison, <em>Power: Hugh Hefner</em> will tackle important questions around the brand’s complicated role in contributing to both progressive movements and oppression.</p>



<p>“As a journalist who examines power and gender dynamics, Playboy has been a constant source of fascination and influence in my work and life. I’ve always wanted to know more about the women who were really responsible for its power: How did Playboy affect the courses of their lives, for better and for worse? I was totally drawn to the story of how a multi-million-dollar business that was supposed to be socially progressive force for good actually affected the people who built it up.” Amy Rose Spiegel said. “With this series I have the enormous pleasure and privilege of uncovering the personal stories of women who knew Hugh Hefner and used the clubs, magazine, and man himself to find their way.”</p>



<p>Several Bunnies, Playmates, magazine employees and feminist activists join this season to offer their first hand experiences with Playboy, including Linda Smith, the daughter of Janet Pilgrim, Playboy’s first magazine star; Jaki Nett (Playboy Bunny and Bunny Mother from 1967-79 and ‘Bunny Mother’), Diane Crothers (who debated Hefner on <em>The Dick Cavett Show</em>); Jeanne Bell (one of the first Black Playmates); Marilyn Grabowski (Playboy’s photography editor for 43 years); Suze Randall (pioneering photographer and pornographer), Marilyn Cole (first full-frontal nude centerfold), and more.</p>



<p>Dave Anderson is the series producer and Peggy Sutton is the executive producer. Paul Smith, Georgia Mills, and Cheeka Eyers also produced the show.</p>

<p><strong>First local Christian label launches with 12 new tracks across a variety of genres</strong></p>



<p><strong>Manila, 26 October 2021 </strong>&#8211; Sony Music Philippines today announced the launch of WATERWALK RECORDS, a music label focused on bringing fresh Christian music to a new, streaming generation. The label will feature faith-based entertainment artists from across the length and breadth of the country, who represent the best of Christian music combined with their own unique styles.</p>



<p>“In the Philippines, Christian music emerges from daily life and is a reflection of the country’s rich culture,” said<strong>&nbsp;Roslyn Pineda, General Manager,&nbsp;Sony Music Philippines</strong>. “Pop music inspired by Christian melodies has arguably created some of the most interesting music in recent years. It’s a diverse genre full of talented artists who use faith as a regular way of connecting with people. WATERWALK RECORDS has huge opportunities to grow as we work with talented artists such as Morissette, Gloryfall and Hazel Faith and others to bring their music to fans all across Southeast Asia”.</p>



<p>“The Philippines is a musically rich country, well known for showcasing the best of Christian music in Southeast Asia,” said <strong>Ariel Fung, EVP, Sony Music Southeast Asia</strong>. “With WATERWALK RECORDS, our vision is to create a hub for Christian music in Asia that serves artists and writers who are creating ground-breaking music and impacting the lives of millions. Our stellar line up of artists we’re working with is just the start of helping us achieve that vision, representing the very best of local and regional talent.”</p>



<p>The artist, <strong>Morissette,</strong> popularly referred to as &#8220;Asia&#8217;s Phoenix&#8221;, will release the label’s first single, <strong>“Waterwalk” </strong>on 28 October. <strong>“Mapayapa”</strong>—a collaboration between Christian worship band <strong>Gloryfall</strong> and singer/songwriter <strong>Hazel Faith</strong>—will be released shortly after.</p>



<p>“I am thrilled to be taking part in Sony Music‘s new Christian label and get to share, and sing, of the word of God and all His great works,“ added <strong>Morissette</strong>. “It&#8217;s only been a couple of years since I&#8217;ve made the decision to really follow Jesus and one thing I can really attest to is that we just need to trust Him in everything. I&#8217;ve been through some very challenging times too especially during this season, but it&#8217;s His grace that saves me and keeps me going, His love that comforts and protects me, and His promise that I will always keep in my heart. The track &#8216;Waterwalk&#8217; portrays all of that, and a reminder that what He has done for His people then, He will also do for His people now, we need only to anchor on to Him.”</p>



<p>Rapper/actor <strong>Jericho Arceo </strong>and <strong>Stell of SB19, </strong>will also release a joint single<strong>. </strong>Arceo is well known for creating viral videos on social media and being a member of the cast for the show <em>The World Between Us, </em>while Stell who is a part of SB19, one of the most popular P-pop groups in the Philippines, is embarking on his first solo venture through this collaboration.</p>



<p>In another first,<strong> Nathan Huang</strong> from the band ‘of Mercury’ (formerly known as Nathan &amp; Mercury) will also have his first solo venture through the label and will collaborate with <strong>Darla Baltazar, </strong>who was recently featured as one of the <em>16 Artists to Watch </em>on the international website <em>The Gospel Coalition</em>.</p>



<p><strong>Janine Danielle</strong>, a worship leader from Favor Church, will be singing a track penned and produced by one of Spotify’s most followed Filipino artists <strong>Moira Dela Torre</strong>, and Moira’s frequent collaborator and husband, <strong>Jason Hernandez.</strong> The lineup also includes singles from beloved worship leaders from various churches in the Philippines: <strong>Lee Simon Brown </strong>(from Victory Worship), <strong>Cola Cabalcar, Kent Charcos, Cherise Katriel, </strong>and <strong>Sam &amp; Steff.</strong></p>



<p>To showcase the richness of the region, WATERWALK RECORDS will also release a single from <strong>Ariel Tsai</strong>, a popular Taiwanese singer/songwriter, pianist, and YouTuber signed under Sony Music Taiwan.</p>



<p>The 12 tracks from WATERWALK RECORDS are expected to be released within this year.</p>

<p><strong><em>The Sellout</em></strong><strong> Follows the Rise and Fall of Disgraced Los Angeles Politician Jose Huizar, Who is Facing Trial on Bribery and Other Charges</strong></p>



<p><strong>First Two Episodes Are Available <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/smoke-screen-the-sellout/id1525807626" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Now</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>New York and Los Angeles – October 26, 2021 –</strong> Neon Hum, in partnership with Sony Music Entertainment, today announced the premiere of “The Sellout,” the newest season of the investigative franchise “Smoke Screen.” Over the past year, Neon Hum teamed up with grassroots media organization L.A. TACO to make this nine-episode season of the podcast. Hosted by seasoned L.A. journalist Mariah Castañeda, “The Sellout” focuses on the rise and fall of Los Angeles city councilmember Jose Huizar, as well as the impact of his betrayal on his constituents. Huizar was arrested last year for allegedly taking bribes from real estate developers interested in building luxury housing and hotels in his district. His trial is currently set for May 2022. The first two episodes are <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/smoke-screen-the-sellout/id1525807626" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">available now</a>. </p>



<p>Huizar grew up in Boyle Heights, a working-class Latinx neighborhood in Los Angeles. He eventually became their councilperson. Huizar’s constituents saw him as a hometown hero, until the day the FBI raided his home and offices, accusing him of leading a criminal enterprise based in city hall. He stands accused of taking bribes from luxury real estate developers as longtime Boyle Heights residents were displaced from their homes. Huizar’s alleged actions reshaped the district, spurring on rapid gentrification in downtown LA, and rent spikes, evictions, and displacement in other parts of the district, including Boyle Heights.</p>



<p>Over the series, Castañeda (&#8220;cas &#8211; ta &#8211; nye &#8211; da&#8221;) investigates how Huizar got the power to do what he did and who helped him do it. The show features conversations with Huizar’s constituents, many of whom were fighting gentrification and displacement in their neighborhoods, unaware that their councilmember was allegedly taking bribes behind closed doors. “Smoke Screen: The Sellout” also digs into the charges against Huizar and the stories of people who warned years ahead of time that something shady might be happening in Huizar’s office.</p>



<p>“I spent over a year reporting on this story about Jose Huizar and his how impact on the residents of Boyle Heights provides a window into the gentrification crisis facing communities across America,” said host Mariah Castañeda “While Smoke Screen: The Sellout’ is the tale of Jose Huizar, the story we’re telling is universal and will resonate with listeners whose neighborhoods are changing and who feel betrayed by their political leaders.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The Sellout” was reported by Mariah Castañeda and Lexis-Olivier Ray at L.A.TACO and Carla Green at Neon Hum. Carla Green is the show’s lead producer and she wrote the episodes. The show’s editor is Catherine Saint Louis and executive producer is Jonathan Hirsch.</p>



<p>Subscribers on Apple Podcasts can get early access to weekly episodes starting Monday, November 1 and special bonus episodes featuring exclusive content. Listeners can go to lataco.com to access a map of locations featured on the show in L.A.</p>

<p><strong>What is your favorite aspect of interning at Sony Music?</strong><br>Interning at Sony Music—where should I even begin?! Sony gave me my first “big girl” internship as a Public Relations intern. There were so many things I absolutely loved about interning here, however, my favorite aspect of interning with the company is definitely the way my SMG team interacted with me and took a genuine interested in my growth and development. &nbsp;</p>



<p>For one, I appreciated working with people who have significant projects and responsibilities (such as the worship leader summer project) so I could learn and work alongside them.</p>



<p>My Sony Music team didn’t treat me like an intern; I was consistently viewed as an equal by all the teammates I worked with. &nbsp;My Public Relations team integrated me into every project and made it apparent my effort and contributions were part of something bigger. &nbsp;Throughout my internship experience, I felt seen, valued, and appreciated.</p>



<p><strong>Tell us about intern workshops and events held throughout the summer. What did you enjoy most about it?</strong><br>I loved that the Talent Development and Talent Acquisition team ensured a standard of balance. They provided our intern class with well-organized and much needed workshops that supported our professional development, in addition to leisure opportunities to meet and greet other interns. We were able to share our internship experiences with one another, motivate each other, and bring out the best in one another. Our internship program leaders showed that they truly care about us as professionals and individuals, and they did excellent job in ensuring that we get the best out of our internship experience. That level of care, in and of itself, has left an impact on me!</p>



<p><strong>What is one of your main/personal takeaways from your Sony Music internship experience?</strong><br>#LifeatSonyMusic exceeded all of my expectations. The tremendous personal and professional growth I’ve experienced during since the start of the internship is beautiful. I joined Sony Music as a timid over-thinker and am departing as a strong-minded and confident young professional. All in all, I just want to say to Sony Music Entertainment.</p>



<p><strong>Last but not least, what’s songs are currently in your rotation and on repeat</strong>?</p>

<p><strong>What’s it like working in Philanthropy &amp; Social Impact?</strong><br>During my time as part of the first cohort of Sony Music Group’s Impact Fellows this summer, I have come to understand the power of music and corporate social responsibility. As the first ever SMG Philanthropy and Social Impact Intern, it has been an honor to support the advancement of SMG’s Social Justice Fund. The fund’s pillars of civic engagement, criminal justice reform and education enable SMG to work with community partners to improve the world we share &#8211; one vote, one life, and one opportunity at a time.</p>



<p>Being on calls with SMG’s international teams who enthusiastically contribute to the expansion of SMG’s philanthropic work around the globe, with the sole purpose of these efforts being to uplift those who need it most, confirmed to me that supporting the advancement of communities is one of my passions.</p>



<p><strong>What are your biggest learnings from the SMG Impact Fellows experience?</strong><br>I learned that while rivers are the arteries of the earth and need to be protected, music represents the veins of culture that pump society’s pain and joy into the spotlight. Music can serve as an important driver of change.  <br> <br>I learned that just as music making boosts executive brain function, strengthens memory, improves mood, and even reduces physical pain, investing in young minds reaps societal benefit beyond what any statistic highlight.<br> <br>I also learned that although environmental, social, political, psychological and health issues seem to be growing just as quickly as technology is evolving, collective commitment and action toward the creation of a better society is happening, and generations to come will accept nothing less than bold action and change!<br><br></p>



<p><strong>What is one of your main/personal takeaways from your Sony Music internship experience?</strong><br>I can say with full certainty this incredible learning opportunity was only possible because of the many who believed in my potential, the support I received from my passionate, talented team and the fact that equity advocacy in corporate spaces truly does make a difference for the better. Often the anxiety imposter syndrome produces tries to defeat us, but those feelings are nothing in comparison to the desire to grow, however uncomfortable the process may be! </p>



<p><br>Amidst the ripples of culture, creation, business, art and difficult global circumstances, the collaboration of for-profit and non-profit work can build meaningful, lasting impact in the communities we live, work and serve in. I am so grateful to have experienced this firsthand during my time at SMG and cannot wait to take the lessons I learned with me in my professional and personal life.</p>

<p><strong>The Story of Steve Kough, An NFL Player, Drug Smuggler and Father who Might Just Own a Priceless Work of Picasso’s Art</strong></p>



<p><strong>First Episode Is Available <a href="https://link.chtbl.com/IYdqiu3o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Now</a></strong></p>



<p><strong>New York, NY – October 18, 2021 –</strong> Somethin’ Else, in partnership with Sony Music Entertainment and Vespucci, today announced the premiere of “Hemingway’s Picasso,” its new investigative podcast series exploring the high-flying life and times of Stephen Kough &#8211; an NFL journeyman male model, and one of the most well-connected smugglers in 1980’s Miami. The first episode is available <a href="https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.chtbl.com%2FIYdqiu3o&amp;data=04%7C01%7Cfrancis.amponsah%40sonymusic.com%7C6771506e244d4491c30308d99247d7f0%7Cf0aff3b791a54aaeaf71c63e1dda2049%7C0%7C0%7C637701659529158724%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=6NK4hsJHBSQaqRp1ck4n%2ByXIMsgPRdCF7CbGid6zJ5g%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">now</a>.</p>



<p>Hosted by writer and author of the true crime memoir <em>Down City </em>Leah Carroll, the podcast traces Kough’s wild adventures, digging into the truth behind his most treasured piece of art: a beautiful ceramic sculpture, crafted by Picasso and gifted to Ernest Hemingway at the author’s Cuban home, the Finca Vigia&#8230;or so the story goes. Supposedly lost during the Cuban Revolution, the artwork resurfaced when Kough took it as a payment for drug run for Pablo Escobar. Kough passed away in 2018, passing the piece down to his son Stevie, a skateboarding hippie growing weed in California.</p>



<p>In “Hemingway’s Picasso,” Carroll works to understand the history of the ceramic &#8211; Is actually a Picasso? Did it really come from Hemingway? Was it meant for the King of Cocaine, Pablo Escobar? Or was Steve Kough another big talker?</p>



<p>Host Leah Carroll said, “‘Hemingway’s Picasso’ offers an immersive look into the seedy and beautiful world of 1980’s Miami, where the cocaine skylines are reflected blue by the sky and water. Join us as we trace this tale of aspiration, legacy and difficult love, as Steve Kough passes this ceramic down to his son Stevie. And we’re left to wonder &#8212; is this is a treasure or a curse?”</p>



<p>“Hemingway’s Picasso” is a Somethin’ Else production. Senior Producer is Pallavi Kottamasu. Associate Producer is India Witkin. Executive Producers are Lizzie Jacobs, Tom Koenig, Steve Ackerman, Johnny Galvin, Daniel Turcan, and Nick Katz.</p>

<p>Today, Sony Music UK announced three new beneficiaries in their latest round of funding from the Global Social Justice Fund. This follows the June 2021 announcement that highlighted key partnerships&nbsp;chosen by a diverse advisory board that represents labels and divisions across Sony Music UK.</p>



<p>So, who are the organizations and what will the new partnerships focus on? </p>

<p>Building on Sony Music UK&#8217;s existing relationship, this innovative partnership&nbsp;aims to research mental health interventions for young people affected by racism.&nbsp;This&nbsp;is&nbsp;sometimes described as racial trauma,&nbsp;but&nbsp;research on&nbsp;the impact of&nbsp;racial trauma is limited to the UK.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Sony Music UK’s funding will enable this&nbsp;important&nbsp;youth-led&nbsp;project to understand the best blueprint for services,&nbsp;given statistics show that people from&nbsp;racialized&nbsp;groups may be more likely to experience mental health problems but less likely to receive appropriate support.</p>



<p>Mind&nbsp;submitted the proposal as part of their aim to be an&nbsp;unflinching advocate for racial justice and mental health and as&nbsp;part of&nbsp;their&nbsp;ambition to become an anti-racist&nbsp;organization.

<p><br><strong>Upcoming Slate to Feature New Seasons of Hit Franchises and Debut of “The Female Gaze” from Bestselling Feminist Author Florence Given</strong></p>



<p><strong>London, UK – October 7, 2021 –</strong> Building on its commitment to global podcast expansion, Sony Music Entertainment (SME) today previewed its robust slate of new original podcast titles and announced the official return of several hit series during its first presentation at the 2021 IAB UK Podcast Upfront.</p>



<p>Highlighting the Company’s strategic approach, Jez Nelson, EVP and Co-Head of Global Podcasts, Sony Music Entertainment, showcased SME’s mission to grow a global podcast business based on its creator first focus in audio entertainment. During its presentation, SME revealed a diverse lineup of new content with its creative partners around the world that will debut in coming months across culture, true crime, politics, history, entertainment and more, including its newest original title exploring the intersection of art, drugs and mystery, “Hemingway’s Picasso,” which will premiere on October 18. In addition, SME showcased several of its chart-topping podcasts from the past year, many of which will return for new seasons soon, including “Smoke Screen: The Sellout” on October 26 and “Power: Hugh Hefner” on November 1.</p>



<p>The company also announced one of its newest projects, “The Female Gaze,” which will premiere next year from illustrator, writer &amp; feminist social activist Florence Given. In the series, the best-selling author and artist will break out of the polarising left and right echo chambers to connect people by raising conversation around provocative issues with passion, humour and sensitivity.</p>



<p>The presentation also featured a special mashup that combined two of SME’s most popular UK shows. Restaurant critic Jay Rayner went “Out to Lunch” with the host of “Something Rhymes with Purple” Susie Dent.&nbsp; There was also a conversation about the art of cheating with Peabody-winning journalist and host of “Cheat!” Alzo Slade.</p>



<p>Jez Nelson said, “Sony Music’s proud history as a global entertainment business has helped strategically position our newly expanded podcast division to super-serve creators and deliver premium original content for audiences around the world. As podcasting continues to grow globally, we are keenly focused on developing more ways to reach diverse audiences and growing audio consumption everywhere.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sony Music is one of fifteen UK companies to have been awarded the YOUNITED Flag, in recognition of our commitment to hiring ex-offenders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Launched in September 2019 by Nile Rodgers and crime prevention charity&nbsp;<a href="https://key4life.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Key4Life</a>,&nbsp;the YOUNITED Flag award encourages companies to employ ex-offenders, rewarding those that do with the prestigious kitemark. Flag-bearing former convicts on horseback paraded at Mansion House for the awards ceremony last week, where&nbsp;Alderman William Russell, the Lord Mayor of the City of London, presented the accolades.</p>



<p>“I’m honoured to present the YOUNITED Flag awards,” said Russell. “It’s remarkable to see graduates from rehabilitation programmes attaining impressive corporate roles because someone cared enough, for long enough, to change their lives. Employing ex-offenders offers the chance to include a new perspective in the workplace and provides a genuine opportunity to do something meaningful by offering these young men a second chance.”</p>



<p>The ceremony also marked the ninth birthday of Key4Life, which has an unrivalled track record for transforming the lives of some of the most disaffected young men in Britain. The charity reduces re-offending through its innovative rehabilitation programme for young men in prison and those at risk of going to prison, saving lives by helping to break the cycle of crime.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Research shows that 50% of corporate Britain would not hire ex-offenders, and yet having a job is the crucial success factor for men with convictions,” said Eva Hamilton, Founder and CEO of Key4Life. “With reoffending costing the UK government £18.1 billion a year, the YOUNITED Flag award highlights how employing ex-offenders can drive change by dispelling stereotypes and removing unfair prejudice.” </p>

<p><em>This article is written by&nbsp;<strong>Jocelyn Peña</strong>&nbsp;and is part of the SMG Impact Fellows Mix Tape Series, a collection of first-person essays written by the inaugural cohort of Sony Music Group Impact Fellows. Read more about the SMG Impact Fellows Program&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sonymusic.com/inside-sony-music/impact-fellows-program/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</em></p>



<p><strong>How would you describe your internship experience, using a song from a Sony Music artist?</strong><br>“I replayed this moment for months/ Alone in my head, waitin’ for it to come”. These lyrics from Camila Cabello’s song “Don’t Go Yet” express how I felt as a Sony Music Intern. I have waited for a moment to intern in the music industry since I was young. As a strong-willed creative with a passion for music, I found my way to Sony Music Entertainment this summer via the MAIP program.</p>



<p><strong>What are you studying now and how is it tied to your internship at Sony Music?</strong><br>I am currently a rising senior studying advertising at the University of Georgia. MAIP is a talent development program that gives talented and diverse entry-level students opportunities in a multitude of industries, including advertising, public relations, and now, music. I was in my finance class when I got a call from Amber Vidals, Senior Associate of The Multicultural Advertising Internship Program (MAIP). When she mentioned that Sony Music Entertainment extended an offer, I put her on mute and screamed. The stars were beginning to align for me. I mentioned to my professor earlier in the semester that I wanted to work in the music industry and that it was where I saw myself in the future. Getting that call motivated me to be my best self and go all in. Sony Music and MAIP have given me an amazing opportunity to pursue my passion, develop my skills, and network with professionals and like-minded peers.</p>



<p><strong>What professional development opportunities did you enjoy/experience at Sony Music Group?</strong><br>Everyone that works at Sony Music has a passion for what they do, and they are willing to mentor their interns. Sony Music offers many workshops where employees in the company, come to share their experiences and give the interns advice. Having the opportunity to network with people that I look up to has been surreal. During the Sony Music internship experience, you get to meet people from all over the company, in addition to teammates in your department and location.</p>



<p><strong>What are you most proud of accomplishing during your internship?</strong><br>One of my greatest accomplishments is successfully helping with several tasks for my supervisor while he took a well-deserved vacation. I helped review daily airplay and consumption reports with promotion staff and artist managers, that included activity statistics from various platforms; as well as  updating artist calendars for travel and logistics. Personally, that task was a big deal because I had earned my supervisor’s trust in just a few short weeks. My attention to detail and confidence strengthened and I was able to grow as a professional during that experience. It was an honor to have him trust me with these responsibilities.</p>



<p><strong>How has your MAIP Fellowship enhanced your Sony Music experience?</strong><br>Aside from working at Sony Music, MAIP Fellows attend weekly labs where we receive additional training, mentorship and hear from guest speakers at different agencies and companies such as Google, Amazon, Dentsu, and other large organizations. You are also assigned two additional summer projects. I had the pleasure of working with David &amp; Goliath Agency for Jollibee, and Adam &amp; Eve Agency for IZZE as their PR strategist. MAIP is always rooting for you, your MAIP coach, your group partners and everyone in the MAIP class. </p>



<p>As I spent my summer interning at Sony Music and MAIP, I think back to my younger self and I know she would be proud — proud of all the sacrifices she made when she would stay after school while her friends went out, proud of the time she took her chemistry packet to a concert to study while singing her lungs out and lastly, proud of being able to tell her immigrant parents she is climbing up the ladder. Thank you, Sony Music and thank you MAIP for paving the way for more opportunities in the music industry.</p>



<p><strong>Last but not least, what’s songs are currently in your rotation and on repeat?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ul><li>“Imagine” – <a href="https://smarturl.it/xPlanetHer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Doja Cat</a></li><li>“Top Off (Homecoming Live)” – <a href="https://smarturl.it/bh9102" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beyonce</a></li><li><a href="https://rauwa.lnk.to/TodoDeTi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Todo De Ti” – Rauw Alejandro</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CFYIOF89hc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Go Crazy” – Chris Brown</a></li><li><a href="https://smarturl.it/xComeThrough" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Come Through” – H.E.R. &amp; Chris Brown</a></li></ul>

Entitled <i>Imposter</i>, Dave takes listeners on a personal journey of 12 meticulously chosen reimagined songs from across genres and time periods, including selections from <span class="xn-person">Neil Young</span>, Bob Dylan, PJ Harvey, <span class="xn-person">Charlie Chaplin</span>, Cat Power and <span class="xn-person">Mark Lanegan</span>, amongst others. </p>

<p>One would be remiss to refer to <i>Imposter</i> as a cover album. Rather, <i>Imposter</i> is a story of songs, which <span class="xn-person">Dave Gahan</span> &amp; Soulsavers listened to, studied, absorbed, and gave a new life. All of the songs have deep meaning to Dave, making <i>Imposter</i> a reflection of Dave&#8217;s life – a story told by others, but in his own distinct voice. </p>
<p>&#8220;When I listen to other people&#8217;s voices and songs—more importantly the way they sing them and interpret the words—I feel at home,&#8221; <span class="xn-person">Dave Gahan</span> confesses. &#8220;I identify with it. It comforts me more than anything else. There&#8217;s not one performer on the record who I haven&#8217;t been moved by.&#8221; He adds, &#8220;I know we made something special, and I hope other people feel that and it takes them on a little kind of trip—especially people who love music and have for years.&#8221;</p>
<p>The first offering from <i>Imposter</i> will be &#8220;Metal Heart.&#8221; Written by <span class="xn-person">Chan Marshall</span> (Cat Power), and first released in 1998, the reimagined version from Dave &amp; Soulsavers will drop on <span class="xn-chron">October 8</span><sup>th</sup>. </p>
<p><b><i>Imposter</i></b><b>&nbsp;track listing:</b></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The Dark End of the Street </li>
<li>Strange Religion </li>
<li>Lilac Wine </li>
<li>I Held My Baby Last Night </li>
<li>A <span class="xn-person">Man Needs</span> a Maid </li>
<li>Metal Heart </li>
<li>Shut Me Down </li>
<li>Where My Love Lies Asleep </li>
<li>Smile </li>
<li>The Desperate Kingdom of Love </li>
<li>Not Dark Yet </li>
<li>Always On My Mind</li>
</ol>
<p>Unlike <span class="xn-person">Dave Gahan</span> &amp; Soulsavers&#8217; past albums which were transatlantic collaborations where the duo recorded separately and passed parts back and forth, the recording of <i>Imposter</i> was done live as a ten-member band at the famed Shangri-La Recording Studio in <span class="xn-location">Malibu, CA</span> in November of 2019. This allowed for not only a more intimate collaboration, but for Dave &amp; Soulsavers to truly absorb the atmosphere and have the space to breathe a different spirit into the tracks. In an interview with podcaster and media personality <span class="xn-person">Chris Black</span>, Dave noted, &#8220;This was the first time we were all in one space. It was kind of lucky [timing] as well… Arriving at Shangri-La every day, it was magical. We&#8217;d have coffee, go in, and work.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>Imposter, </i>also produced by <span class="xn-person">Rich Machin</span> and <span class="xn-person">Dave Gahan</span>, serves as the collaborators&#8217; third album, following their critically acclaimed 2015 release <i>Angels &amp; Ghosts</i> and their first release, 2012&#8217;s <i>The Light the Dead See.</i>&nbsp;The album will be released in digital, as well as physical formats, worldwide on <span class="xn-chron">November 12th</span> through Columbia Records.</p>

<p><strong><em>Film to Chronicle the Life and Career of Vocal Powerhouse from Oscar®-Nominated Filmmaker</em></strong></p>



<p><strong>New York, NY – September 28, 2021 –</strong> Sony Music Entertainment’s (SME) Premium Content Division, in partnership with SME Canada and Vermilion Films, today announced start of production for an untitled feature-length documentary about Celine Dion. From Oscar®-nominated filmmaker Irene Taylor, the documentary will serve as the definitive feature for one of the most immediately recognized, widely respected and successful performers in pop music history. Made with Dion’s full participation and support, the film will commemorate the Canadian songstress’ incredible life story and career accomplishments including iconic album releases, award accolades, world tours and Las Vegas residencies.</p>



<p>Imagined through the lens of acclaimed American filmmaker Irene Taylor, the documentary will delve deep into Dion’s singular life experience. Most recently, Taylor directed the Emmy®-nominated documentary <em>Moonlight Sonata: Deafness in Three Movements</em>. Her debut feature film, <em>Hear and Now</em>, won a Peabody Award and the Sundance Film Festival Audience Award. Additional accolades include a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Children’s Program for her short film, <em>One Last Hug</em>, as well as an Academy Award® nomination for <em>The Final Inch</em>, which also garnered multiple Emmy nominations and the International Documentary Association’s Pare Lorentz Award.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always been an open book with my fans, and with her sensitivity and thoughtful creativity I think&nbsp;that Irene will be able to show everyone a part of me that they haven’t seen before… I know she’ll tell my story in the most honest and heartfelt way,” said Celine Dion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Going on this journey with a legendary artist such as Celine Dion is an extraordinary opportunity for me as a filmmaker.&nbsp;Having access to examine her life and inimitable career, will allow me to create a multifaceted portrait of an iconic, global superstar, which I look forward to sharing with the world,” said Irene Taylor.</p>



<p>Since bursting onto the global music scene at the age of 14, Dion has sold over 250 million albums during her 40-year career. Having earned five Grammy Awards, two Academy Awards®, the 2016 Billboard Music Award lifetime achievement Icon Award, and recognition from the 2004 World Music Awards as the best-selling female artist of all time, Dion continues to break records. With chart-topping hits featured in blockbuster films including “Ashes” (<em>Deadpool 2</em>), “My Heart Will Go On” (<em>Titanic</em>), and “Beauty and the Beast” (<em>Beauty and the Beast</em>), she remains a force in the industry and sets new standards of excellence. Later this year, Dion will return to Las Vegas with a brand-new show at Resorts World Las Vegas, kicking-off her new residency with 10 performances in November 2021.&nbsp; Her Courage World Tour, which was cut short in 2020 due to COVID, will resume across North America and Europe in spring and summer of 2022.</p>



<p>“Celine Dion is one of the most sought-after recording artists of all time.&nbsp; We are honored to collaborate with her to produce this much-anticipated documentary,” said Tom Mackay, President, Premium Content, Sony Music Entertainment. “Led by Irene Taylor’s incredible artistic vision, we look forward to celebrating Dion’s life achievements and crafting a distribution strategy to reach her fans around the globe.”</p>



<p>Sony Music Entertainment is financing and distributing the film. Krista Wegener, Senior Vice President, Sales and Distribution, Premium Content, Sony Music Entertainment, will lead global sales for the film.</p>

<p><strong>What does music mean to you and how does your outlook on music fit in with your internship at Sony Music Group?</strong><br>During my summer internship at Sony Music as an international marketer of Sony Music’s U.S.-signed artists, my perspective on the music industry and the international influence of American artists has broadened exponentially. Artists with followings of all sizes have global impact, and it is incredibly cool to know that people miles away from one another, speaking a whole different language, can still connect to and dance to the same song. Music really is an experience that is worth sharing with others, so I’m excited to share my experiences as a Sony Music intern.</p>



<p>To me, music is like a cup of hot chocolate on a snowy day—or icing on my favorite cake! It is a foolproof companion through hardships and an amplifier of our emotions. If I could describe my internship experience, it would be spicy ramen. It was challenging, and it made me want to take a step back and grab some milk, but as soon as I felt some form of relief, I couldn’t wait to dig right back into it. Having the opportunity to grow and learn with Sony Music, while identifying areas where I could improve was one of the most fulfilling parts of my experience.</p>



<p><strong>What does an average week look like in International Marketing?</strong><br>At Sony Music, my day-to-day tasks include identifying and keeping track of trends globally, creating digital newsletters to send to the international team, updating the statistics and data for our priority artists, and researching heavily on social media platforms such as TikTok. My favorite aspect is having the opportunity to brainstorm creative ideas for global launch campaigns, and pitching ideas to boost advertisements globally by seeing what trends are resonating across various communities. I also love to help summarize international marketing plans and spends. It allows me to see what kind of creativity, budgets, and expectations other markets have in mind for our global artists. The projects and initiatives I’ve worked on are honestly amazing, I’ve loved every part of my Sony Music growth journey!</p>



<p><strong>Could you tell us about one of your highlights of the role?</strong><br>Throughout my time on the International Marketing team, I noticed how quickly our teammates and projects move and how well we collaborate and work together. When I first started, I was not used to the fast pace, but as time passed and with the support of my teammates, I overcame that challenge and adapted to the fast-paced environment. I was also able to improve and enhance my creative thinking in an actionable way. Every now and then I would come up with ambitious ideas that seemed out of this world. While working at Sony Music, I’ve learned how to bring some of those ideas to fruition by building out a realistic strategy. I am so happy I had the opportunity to spend time with such a talented, multifaceted team. I also want to give a special shoutout to my supervisors Keri and Julio, who really took care of me this summer and enriched my experiences in many ways. </p>



<p><strong>How would you describe your Sony Internship Experience using a song from a Sony Music artist?</strong><br>I am so delighted I was able to learn and grow with Sony Music over the past 10 weeks. It was undoubtedly the highlight of my summer. We know that music is associated with memories, and I hope that in the future, whenever I hear “Stay” by The Kid LAROI and Justin Bieber, I can relive the upbeat moments I experienced this summer on the International Marketing team at Sony Music.</p>



<p><strong>Last but not least, what songs are currently in your rotation and on repeat?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTJczUoc26U" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Stay” – The Kid LAROI, Justin Bieber</a></li><li><a href="https://smarturl.it/TatexKhalidxWorking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Working” – Tate McRae, Khalid</a></li><li><a href="https://smarturl.it/xKMMx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&#8220;Kiss Me More&#8221; – Doja Cat (feat SZA)</a></li><li><a href="https://lilnasx.lnk.to/IndustryBaby" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Industry Baby”&nbsp;– Lil Nas X, Jack Harlow</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFPkd-7AcDM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Don’t Go Yet” – Camila Cabello</a> </li></ul>

<p></p>



<p>&#8220;A few years ago, I started re-examining the filmed archives for Bruce and the Band’s appearances at the No Nukes concerts of 1979,&#8221; said Thom Zimny. &#8220;I quickly realized that these were the best performances and best filming from the Band’s legendary Seventies, and dedicated myself to bringing out the full potential of the footage.&nbsp; Having worked as Bruce’s principal director and editor for the last 20 years, I can say without reservation that this newly re-edited, re-mixed and restored ninety minute film is the gold standard for Bruce and the Band live during one of their greatest creative periods.&#8221;</p>



<p>“The Seventies were a golden period in the history of Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, and the Legendary 1979 No Nukes Concerts is the greatest document of that era we will ever have,&#8221; said Jon Landau. &#8220;It’s a pure rock show from beginning to end, the energy level is transcendent, and the mastery of the art and the craft of rock music is awe inspiring.”</p>



<p>“We’re thrilled to be able to give audiences around the world the opportunity to witness these groundbreaking performances,” said Tom Mackay, President, Premium Content, Sony Music Entertainment. “‘The Legendary 1979 No Nukes Concerts’ is a rare opportunity to experience an event that became an instant classic and marked a pivotal moment for Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band.”</p>

<p>A composite of two performances captured during the multi-day &#8216;No Nukes&#8217; concerts, the film packs the intensity of a marathon Bruce Springsteen and The E Street Band show into a crackling 90 minute run-time. Among the highlights are then-unreleased versions of &#8220;The River&#8221; and &#8220;Sherry Darling,&#8221; live staples &#8220;Badlands,&#8221; &#8220;Born To Run&#8221; and &#8220;Thunder Road,&#8221; plus covers of Buddy Holly’s “Rave On” and a version of Maurice Williams’ “Stay&#8221; featuring special guests Jackson Browne, Tom Petty and Rosemary Butler. Noted film producer Jon Kilik, who served in the camera crew for the No Nukes concerts and penned liner notes for this release, reflects that &#8220;magic was in the air. The energy on stage and from the crowd was beyond measure and description.&#8221; &#8220;The Legendary 1979 No Nukes Concerts&#8221; were captured while Springsteen and the E Street Band were in the midst of recording&nbsp;<em>The River</em>&nbsp;and just after the conclusion of their breakout 1978 Darkness Tour, marking a rare chance to witness the future Rock and Roll Hall of Famers comprehensively in the heart of their reputation-making rise.</p>

<p><strong>New York &amp; Los Angeles &#8211; September 21, 2021</strong> &#8211; <em>Buddy Guy: The Blues Chase the Blues Away</em>, the new documentary on<em> </em>living legend<strong> </strong>George “Buddy” Guy, a blues master who transcended his early years as a sharecropper in Lettsworth, Louisiana to become one of the most influential guitarists of all time, is available for <a href="https://www.sonypictures.com/movies/buddyguytheblueschasethebluesaway" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">digital purchase and rental today</a>. A Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee and eight-time GRAMMY winner, Guy is a pioneer of Chicago’s fabled West Side sound and a living link to the city’s halcyon days of electric blues. Click here for more information on <a href="https://www.sonypictures.com/movies/buddyguytheblueschasethebluesaway" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to watch.</a></p>



<p>The documentary film features intimate, original interviews with Guy and archival and never-before-seen performances, including footage of the blues legend on stage with the likes of President Obama and The Rolling Stones. Interweaving archival interviews with Muddy Waters, Lightnin’ Hopkins and Willie Dixon with original interviews with musicians Guy influenced, including John Mayer, Carlos Santana, Gary Clark, Jr., Kingfish and more, the film traces Guy’s rich career and lasting impact as one of the final surviving connections to an historic era in the country’s musical evolution.</p>



<p>After moving from Louisiana in the 1950s, Guy quickly rose to prominence as the go-to guitarist for Waters and Howlin’ Wolf amidst the iconic Chicago blues scene, directly inspiring The Rolling Stones, Jimmy Page, Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, Stevie Ray Vaughan and many more. Yet solo commercial success consistently eluded Guy until a late-career breakthrough in the 1990s. A tale of decades-long perseverance, Guy’s journey reflects both the Black experience in America in the 20<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century and the history of the blues.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Buddy Guy: The Blues Chase the Blues Away</em>&nbsp;is a production of Sony Music Entertainment’s Premium Content Division, RCA Records and Scheme Engine in association with American Masters Pictures. The film is directed by Devin Amar, Matt Mitchener and Charles Todd. John Beug and Sheira Rees-Davies are the producers. Michael Kantor, Camille Yorrick, Devin Amar and Sheira Rees-Davies are Executive Producers. Sony Music Entertainment’s Premium Content Division is the distributor of the film.</p>

<p>Of &#8220;<b>Sweet Child O&#8217; Mine</b>,&#8221; 2CELLOS say: &#8220;It&#8217;s one of those classic legendary songs, so we had to do it! We&#8217;d been thinking about recording it for a long time. It&#8217;s our typical 2CELLOS style—rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll on the cello. It&#8217;s how we started, and it&#8217;s what we came back to now. I don&#8217;t know why it took us this long, but we&#8217;re happy we finally did it!&#8221;</p>
<p>Following a brief hiatus for 2CELLOS, which found both Luka and HAUSER using the opportunity to build on their accomplishments by each releasing their own debut solo albums, the duo linked up again in the studio amidst the 2020 global pandemic to reimagine the pop anthems and timeless rock staples that encompass the ten tracks on <i>Dedicated.</i> The arrangement process relied on a combination of gut instinct and intense study, practice, and transposition as the duo recharged instantly recognizable by everyone from Billie Eilish to Guns N&#8217; Roses. </p>
<p>2CELLOS explore a diverse catalog with their signature boundary-breaking playing style on<i> Dedicated</i>.&nbsp; The collection includes their take on everything from classic pop hits (&#8220;bad guy&#8221; by Billie Eilish, &#8220;Shallow&#8221; by Lady Gaga, &#8220;Halo&#8221; by Beyonce) to hard-hitting rock songs (&#8220;<a target="_blank" href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3294641-1&amp;h=346350140&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DVvqImsjpfPo&amp;a=Livin%27+on+a+Prayer" rel="nofollow noopener">Livin&#8217; on a Prayer</a>,&#8221; by Bon Jovi, &#8220;<a target="_blank" href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3294641-1&amp;h=1602415740&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DymepYcHyTfU&amp;a=Cryin%27" rel="nofollow noopener">Cryin&#8217;</a>&#8221; by Aerosmith, &#8220;<a target="_blank" href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3294641-1&amp;h=327299667&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DJ1JFt-db-0M&amp;a=Demons" rel="nofollow noopener">Demons</a>&#8221; by Imagine Dragons, &#8220;<a target="_blank" href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3294641-1&amp;h=1671822660&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2Fr6glBvXN6H0&amp;a=Sweet+Child+O%27+Mine" rel="nofollow noopener">Sweet Child O&#8217; Mine</a>&#8221; by Guns N&#8217; Roses, &#8220;Wherever I Go&#8221; by OneRepublic) to celebrated classics (&#8220;Sound of Silence&#8221; by Simon and Garfunkel) for a one-of-a-kind listening experience.&nbsp; Complete track list below.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you listen to us, we hope you realize the cello is a versatile and diverse instrument capable of playing the hardest rock, the softest ballad, and the most contemporary of music,&#8221; 2CELLOS note. &#8220;It moves you in a way that&#8217;s equally powerful. It has a whole palette of emotions, ups, and downs. We&#8217;re trying to give you an experience you can&#8217;t get anywhere else.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of &#8220;<b>Sweet Child O&#8217; Mine</b>,&#8221; 2CELLOS say: &#8220;It&#8217;s one of those classic legendary songs, so we had to do it! We&#8217;d been thinking about recording it for a long time. It&#8217;s our typical 2CELLOS style—rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll on the cello. It&#8217;s how we started, and it&#8217;s what we came back to now. I don&#8217;t know why it took us this long, but we&#8217;re happy we finally did it!&#8221;</p>
<p>Following a brief hiatus for 2CELLOS, which found both Luka and HAUSER using the opportunity to build on their accomplishments by each releasing their own debut solo albums, the duo linked up again in the studio amidst the 2020 global pandemic to reimagine the pop anthems and timeless rock staples that encompass the ten tracks on <i>Dedicated.</i> The arrangement process relied on a combination of gut instinct and intense study, practice, and transposition as the duo recharged instantly recognizable by everyone from Billie Eilish to Guns N&#8217; Roses. </p>
<p>2CELLOS explore a diverse catalog with their signature boundary-breaking playing style on<i> Dedicated</i>.&nbsp; The collection includes their take on everything from classic pop hits (&#8220;bad guy&#8221; by Billie Eilish, &#8220;Shallow&#8221; by Lady Gaga, &#8220;Halo&#8221; by Beyonce) to hard-hitting rock songs (&#8220;<a target="_blank" href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3294641-1&amp;h=346350140&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DVvqImsjpfPo&amp;a=Livin%27+on+a+Prayer" rel="nofollow noopener">Livin&#8217; on a Prayer</a>,&#8221; by Bon Jovi, &#8220;<a target="_blank" href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3294641-1&amp;h=1602415740&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DymepYcHyTfU&amp;a=Cryin%27" rel="nofollow noopener">Cryin&#8217;</a>&#8221; by Aerosmith, &#8220;<a target="_blank" href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3294641-1&amp;h=327299667&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DJ1JFt-db-0M&amp;a=Demons" rel="nofollow noopener">Demons</a>&#8221; by Imagine Dragons, &#8220;<a target="_blank" href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3294641-1&amp;h=1671822660&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2Fr6glBvXN6H0&amp;a=Sweet+Child+O%27+Mine" rel="nofollow noopener">Sweet Child O&#8217; Mine</a>&#8221; by Guns N&#8217; Roses, &#8220;Wherever I Go&#8221; by OneRepublic) to celebrated classics (&#8220;Sound of Silence&#8221; by Simon and Garfunkel) for a one-of-a-kind listening experience.&nbsp; Complete track list below.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you listen to us, we hope you realize the cello is a versatile and diverse instrument capable of playing the hardest rock, the softest ballad, and the most contemporary of music,&#8221; 2CELLOS note. &#8220;It moves you in a way that&#8217;s equally powerful. It has a whole palette of emotions, ups, and downs. We&#8217;re trying to give you an experience you can&#8217;t get anywhere else.&#8221;</p>

<p><em>This article is written by <strong>Madilyne Nguyen-Acosta</strong> and is part of the SMG Impact Fellows Mix Tape Series, a collection of first-person essays written by the inaugural cohort of Sony Music Group Impact Fellows. Read more about the SMG Impact Fellows Program <a href="https://www.sonymusic.com/inside-sony-music/impact-fellows-program/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. </em></p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Tell us about the MAIP recruitment process and how the program connected you to Sony Music Group. What should a student expect to happen?</strong><br>Applying for MAIP is a challenging, rigorous process. You must select your desired disciplines, the preferred cities you’d like to work in, answer four essay questions, submit a letter of recommendation, and provide a three-minute video showcasing who you are. It’s not guaranteed, but the majority of MAIP Fellows are offered a 10-week internship that they partake in, in addition to the professional coaching and workshops that are built into the MAIP program.</p>



<p>For me, the essay questions and video were the hardest part of the application process because you want to showcase yourself while making your message clear and concise. One thing that helped me while writing my answers and filming my video, was peer feedback. While working on my application, I found myself in a cycle of constant self-critique but getting feedback from my family and peers reassured me that I was sharing my true and authentic self. Once you submit your application, you wait several weeks to find out if you’re a finalist, and another month or two to receive an internship offer.</p>



<p>When I found out that Sony Music Group offered me a Diversity, Equity &amp; Inclusion internship position I literally jumped up and down in my room and screamed. I immediately knew that I had to accept the offer. Without hesitation, I logged onto my MAIP portal, hit “accept” then called my friends and family to tell them the great news. It was a full circle moment. My mom’s first job was with Sony Electronics back in the day, and my dad has always been in the entertainment industry as a DJ. I knew immediately that this opportunity was perfect for me and was excited to bring my skills and experience to the table.</p>



<p><strong>What advice can you offer to future SMG Impact Fellows?</strong><br>At virtual spring training, MAIP gave us tips and advice on how to make the most of our virtual internship experience. During the first week, insight from MAIP helped me not only to make a great first impression on my supervisor, but also establish solid habits and standards for myself to keep throughout the duration of my internship.</p>



<p>For me, this included greeting my supervisor right when I log on, as if I were greeting in the physical office. It was my way of letting her know that I was online and ready to seize the day. I also made sure to go over what was expected of me, her preferred communication style, and what projects I’d be assisting with throughout the summer.</p>



<p>If I were to share a helpful tip to other interns, it’d be to block off or schedule your lunch breaks on your calendar and treat them like a meeting. In a virtual setting, it can be hard to step away from the screen or even realize that you may be hungry. Doing this helped me set a personal boundary for myself that also improved my productivity and overall mental health!</p>



<p><strong>What does an average week look like in the Office of DE&amp;I?</strong><br>The work our office engages in is very dynamic and changes from week to week, so it’s challenging to describe an ‘average’ week for the Office of DE&amp;I at Sony Music Group. Our team was formally established just a year ago with the hiring of Executive Vice President &amp; Chief Diversity &amp; Inclusion Officer Tiffany R. Warren, so there plenty of exciting growth opportunities to pursue and take advantage of. I often get added to calls with our external DE&amp;I partners, compile industry research for our team, and assist with administrative work. Although administrative work doesn’t sound like the most fun thing to do, it’s necessary. I truly feel like I’m helping build the foundation for our office to succeed and continue being DE&amp;I leaders in the music industry. What I love most about my weeks online is genuinely feeling like I’m was a key part of an effort when I get to see the final product of projects I’ve contributed to. There’s no greater feeling!</p>



<p><strong>What’s your favorite part about working with Sony Music Group?</strong><br>My favorite part about working with Sony Music Group is the people! I’ve had the opportunity to meet fellow interns and other professionals in different departments who have been so welcoming and enthusiastic toward me.&nbsp;It sounds cliché, but I also love getting to listen to music whenever I want to! On a more serious note, each day, I learn more about diversity, equity, and inclusion in the music industry. I’m so grateful to be supporting Sony Music Group’s DE&amp;I efforts and making history in the music industry, all thanks to the partnership between MAIP and SMG. &nbsp;</p>

<p>This summer, Sony Music Group, the first music industry partner of the <a href="https://www.aaaa.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">4A’s Multicultural Advertising Intern Program</a> (MAIP), proudly launched the Sony Music Group (SMG) Impact Fellows Program. This bespoke SMG x MAIP partnership will accelerate and strengthen Sony Music Group’s efforts to recruit, develop, and retain diverse entry-level talent. The first cohort of SMG Impact Fellows was comprised of five multicultural and multidisciplinary fellows who worked across several Sony Music teams including <strong>International Marketing</strong>, <strong>Diversity, Equity &amp; Inclusion</strong>, <strong>Sony Music Nashville</strong>, <strong>Provident Label Group</strong>, and <strong>Philanthropy &amp; Social Impact</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Sony Music Group is incredibly proud to partner with the 4A’s Foundation MAIP to provide diverse-entry level talent with direct access to the music industry,&#8221; says <meta charset="utf-8"><strong>Tiffany R. Warren, Executive Vice President &amp; Chief Diversity &amp; Inclusion Officer at Sony Music Group</strong>. &#8220;Our inaugural cohort of SMG Impact Fellows brought a breadth of experiences and incredible insights to our organization in just 10 weeks. This partnership is one example of SMG’s intentional focus on developing the next generation of diverse leaders in music and beyond.” </p>



<p>The SMG Impact Fellow program provides diverse young professionals with the unique opportunity to learn about and experience the music industry during a 10-week summer internship, supplemented by several weeks of professional development opportunities and programming from MAIP.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to <meta charset="utf-8"><strong>Reema Elghossain, Vice President, Talent Equity &amp; Inclusion at 4A’s Foundation</strong>, MAIP has provided thousands of young diverse professionals with opportunities across industries for over four decades. <meta charset="utf-8">Elghossain continues: &#8220;Our partnership with Sony Music Group is a continuation of our commitment and enables us to support, advance, and expand diversity and inclusion efforts throughout an incredibly influential, culture-shaping industry. We’re thankful for Sony Music Group’s support and look forward to the evolution of our partnership.” </p>



<p>In advance of the internship term and throughout the summer, fellows participate in over 20 hours of virtual training to prepare for their full-time experience. Throughout the internship term, MAIP collaborates to create custom content for the MAIP cohort, including pairing each fellow with a MAIP coach, hosting biweekly MAIP labs led by industry partners, facilitating summer projects and organizing ‘The Face of Talent’, a week-long series of events at the end of the internship term designed to celebrate diverse talent and to connect fellows to companies actively seeking talent for full-time opportunities.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s an honor to be a part of the first cohort of SMG Impact Fellows,&#8221; shares <meta charset="utf-8"><strong>Madilyne Nguyen-Acosta, Sony Music Group Impact Fellow, MAIP 2021 Alum, and SMG Office of DE&amp;I Intern</strong>. &#8220;Finding out I was going to be working in the music industry was a full circle moment. My mom’s first job was with Sony Electronics back in the day, and my dad has always been in the entertainment industry as a DJ. I knew immediately that this opportunity was perfect for me and was excited to bring my skills and experience to the table. And, the internship ended on a high note, as I’ll be joining Sony Music Group full time in the fall.”</p>

<p><strong>For the First Time, Fashion Designer Liz Lange Reveals the Truth Behind the Meteoric Rise and Staggering Fall of Her Family, Once One of the Richest in America</strong></p>



<p><strong><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/id1578946278" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Click Here to Listen to the First Two Episodes</a>; All Episodes Available Ad-Free Today for Apple Podcasts Subscribers</strong></p>



<p><strong>New York, NY – September 9, 2021 –</strong>&nbsp;Three Uncanny Four Productions, in partnership with Sony Music Entertainment, today announced the premiere of “The Just Enough Family,” a podcast hosted by&nbsp;<em>New Yorker</em>&nbsp;writer and bestselling author Ariel Levy. The eight-episode series tells the true story of the Steinberg family—who once thought of themselves as “the Jewish Kennedys”—through the memories of successful fashion designer and retail pioneer brand builder Liz Lange and other members of the family, who speak on the record for the first time about their stunning rise and fall. The first two episodes are available now with new episodes releasing every Thursday. Subscribe on Apple Podcasts to binge the entire season, ad-free starting today.</p>



<p>Lange, CEO and Head Designer of Figue, founder of the revolutionary maternity brand Liz Lange Maternity, and niece of the corporate raider and family patriarch Saul Steinberg, gives her close friend Levy an inside look at life in her family. Levy brings listeners startlingly unguarded conversations with all the members of Lange’s family, whose varying versions of how their seemingly invincible clan fell apart are woven together into a riveting tale of feuds, deceptions, profound family intimacy, over-the-top parties, unexpected losses, and shocking betrayals. Listeners get an unprecedented level of access to these characters and a front row seat to this high-profile family-therapy session.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“From the first time I heard Liz’s story I was mesmerized,” said host Ariel Levy, “and I know listeners will be, too. It’s a very American tale of ambition and a family’s glittering rise to the pinnacle of wealth and society, but it’s also a deeply intimate look at what it means to be a daughter, parent, or sibling— and an exploration of how much is enough.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;When I was a child, I made up a story about living with the Just Enough Family: they could always get the next meal, they slept in one big bed, they weren&#8217;t hurting, but they had just enough&#8230;whereas we had way too much,&#8221; said star Liz Lange. &#8220;I grew up around crazy wealth&#8211;private planes, private helicopters, Park Avenue, multiple weekend/summer homes, you name it. This podcast is about what that was like, how all that money brought us together and—when it disappeared—tore us apart, and the way we all put ourselves back together again.&#8221;</p>



<p>“The Just Enough Family” is executive produced by Melinda Shopsin at Three Uncanny Four.</p>



<p>Listeners can subscribe to “The Just Enough Family” on all major podcast platforms, including Apple Podcasts, Spotify and Stitcher.

<p><strong><em>Kevin Foo, General Manager of Sony Music Taiwan, comments on the award and how music is evolving in Taiwan—and across the globe.</em></strong></p>



<p> </p>



<p></p>



<p>This week, Sony Music Taiwan has been named one of HR Asia&#8217;s <a href="https://awards.hrasiamedia.com/taiwan-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Companies to Work For In Asia 2021</a>, following responses from over 22,500 employees across 292 companies in the country. </p>

</div></figure>



<p>We sat down with <strong>Kevin Foo</strong> to learn more about what makes the company such a great place to work for employees, and to discuss how Sony Music Taiwan broke through to be the first entertainment/music company featured on this list in the Award’s history.</p>



<p> </p>



<p><strong>Q: How long have you been with Sony Music Taiwan, and what made you want to join the team originally?&nbsp;</strong><br>&#8220;I have been with Sony Music Taiwan for two years. Previously, I ran my own indie label and production company out of Singapore, and when those entities were acquired, I was given the opportunity to broaden my scope and work with the amazing Sony Music Taiwan team. </p>



<p>&#8220;Being able to work in an exciting market like Taiwan with the amazing artists and talents that have given the world some of the biggest Asian hits over the last three decades, and under the executive leadership of Shridhar Subramaniam, Andrew Chan and Andrew Smith, were all key to saying yes to this role.”</p>



<p><meta charset="utf-8"><strong>Q:</strong> <strong>Being a General Manager&nbsp;in the&nbsp;music&nbsp;industry&nbsp;can&nbsp;look&nbsp;different company to company. Could you describe your role&nbsp;as&nbsp;Sony Music Taiwan’s General Manager?&nbsp;</strong><br>&#8220;I am very blessed to be in the music industry, which is filled with people who are passionate about artists and music. My role at &nbsp;Sony Music Taiwan is about facilitating change as the music environment and consumer habits shift; and adapting to the ever-changing landscape of music production, artist development, music marketing and music consumption.</p>



<p>&#8220;The different trending platforms, the way people discover music, the way people engage with artists have been constantly changing over the last two decades, and change is happening at a faster rate now than ever before. As such, I aim to set relevant goals and targets and encourage innovation across different departments.</p>



<p>&#8220;Most importantly, my role is to do all of this while remembering that we deal with such a precious cultural commodity: our artists and their music. Which has the ability to entertain, change lives, impact people and illicit emotional responses in the most profound ways.&#8221;</p>



<p><meta charset="utf-8"><strong>Q:</strong> <strong>Could you name one or two recent proud moments for Sony Music Taiwan?&nbsp;</strong><br>&#8220;I joined Sony Music Taiwan at the point when the company had just licensed out the physical business, and with that I knew that I needed to make the digital business our primary focus. So, it was an amazing testament to the team when we moved from being third place in digital market share in Taiwan in 2018, to first place in digital market share by the end of 2019.</p>



<p>&#8220;I am very proud of the team for getting to that position within a year, and maintaining the number one position in digital market share in Taiwan every quarter since.&#8221;</p>



<p><meta charset="utf-8"><strong>Q:</strong> <strong>What are a few things coming up for Sony Music Taiwan that you’re excited about?&nbsp;</strong><br>&#8220;I am excited about the team’s continued efforts with developing amazing emerging talent from Taiwan, as well as the team’s effort to grow the footprint of our repertoire, not just domestically, but across the region as well. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ericchou0622/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eric Chou</a>, <a href="https://instagram.com/weibirdmusic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Weibird</a>, <a href="https://instagram.com/vivianhsu.ironv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vivian Hsu</a> and <a href="https://instagram.com/jsheonofficial" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">J.Sheon</a> are all names that continue to grow their audiences in Taiwan and beyond, thanks to the passion and industrious work from different teams across the business.</p>



<p>&#8220;I am also grateful for the challenge and trust that Andrew Chan, our Managing Director of Greater China, has given me to spearhead the expansion of C-Pop—across the Greater China region and beyond. We are looking forward to more amazing collaborations between some of our key priority artists and artists from other parts of the world. “The world of music is truly becoming a smaller place—the next global superstar potentially coming up from anywhere—and I am excited to witness the next superstar come out of Sony Music Taiwan.&#8221;</p>



<p><meta charset="utf-8"><strong>Q:</strong> <strong>How does your work on social justice and social responsibility play a part in the work culture there?</strong><br>&#8220;First and foremost, our social justice work is part of our DNA and it is crucial to fulfilling our responsibilities as citizens of the world.</p>



<p>&#8220;Growing up in Singapore, in a multi-ethnic, multi-religious and culturally diverse society, made me mindful and sensitive to issues that can result from imbalances and a lack of diversity. When I moved to Taiwan, I felt that the Sony Music Taiwan company was already in a strong position regarding diversity and inclusion. But I also saw opportunity to do more, expanding our impact on diversity and inclusion both through the work of our artists and also through volunteering and support we provide as a company.</p>



<p>&#8220;For example, our <a href="https://www.sonymusic.com/sonymusic/sony-music-taiwan-launches-programme-with-national-taitung-university/">tie-up with the National Taitung University</a> in rural Taitung gave us an opportunity to work with students from diverse and disadvantaged backgrounds. Over 12 months, students majoring in music benefitted from a series of mentoring and hands-on workshops from our employees and artists to help build the skills needed for a career in music. At the end of the course, we also offered internship placements to students from diverse and disadvantaged backgrounds.</p>



<p>&#8220;This helped to expand our employees understanding, sense of community and cultural impact beyond just the company’s business goals.&#8221;</p>



<p><meta charset="utf-8"><strong>Q:</strong> <strong><em>A</em>ccording to&nbsp;<em>HR Asia</em>,&nbsp;the awards this year&nbsp;emphasize&nbsp;“a story of resilience, strength, empathy and care of the companies to their employees amidst the pandemic.”&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you speak a little bit about how Sony Music Taiwan cared, and continues to care, for employees during a global pandemic?&nbsp;</strong><br>&#8220;Sony Music Taiwan reacted quickly to news of the pandemic, and implemented protocols like social distancing, temperature taking and mask wearing from the very onset of the pandemic. We also ensured that employees were able to move to a 100% work from home set-up, so they could focus on the health and well-being of themselves and their families.</p>



<p>&#8220;Our employee’s mental health has been my main focus this past year, which is why we made available weekly meditation sessions as well as ‘virtual tea sessions’ where one-to-one catch-up chats could be arranged with senior managers in the company.</p>



<p>&#8220;Most importantly, we also used the opportunity to work closely with the HR Learning &amp; Development team to provide a variety of online upskilling courses to ensure employees had opportunities to further their knowledge and expand on their skillsets from home.&#8221;</p>



<p><meta charset="utf-8"><strong>Q:</strong> <strong>In your opinion, what do you think makes Sony Music Taiwan one of the best companies to work for in Asia?&nbsp;</strong><br>&#8220;I think a work environment where employees can feel like they believe in the company’s vision and goals, where their ideas are heard and their efforts appreciated, where their collective efforts move the needle, and where every individual is valued and the work they do is relevant and impactful, is truly a work environment that one aspires to be in. I believe the team in Sony Music Taiwan has managed to create an environment like this, and I feel for that reason, it is one of the best companies to work for here in Asia.&#8221;</p>



<p><meta charset="utf-8"><strong>Q:</strong> <strong>Considering that this is the&nbsp;first&nbsp;time&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Award’s&nbsp;history&nbsp;that&nbsp;an&nbsp;entertainment or music company in Taiwan&nbsp;has&nbsp;received&nbsp;this award,&nbsp;do you think that adds to the significance of this&nbsp;award?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><br>&#8220;I believe so! I think the music industry is an extremely fun and exciting industry to be in. However it is also fraught in its share of challenges and stereotypes. I think this award is affirmation that Sony Music Taiwan is an equitable employer, even when compared with companies across other industries, and Sony Music Taiwan is an organization that continues to adapt and evolve with the changes in the ever-changing music, entertainment, digital and social responsibility spaces.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Investigative Journalist Rob D’Amico Hosts First Season, “Witnessed: Borderlands,” Diving Into the Unsparing Analysis of the War on Drugs </strong></p>

<p><strong>New York, NY – September 7, 2021 –</strong> Campside Media, in partnership with Sony Music Entertainment, today premiered the investigative podcast series “Witnessed: Borderlands,” the tall-but-true tale of a charismatic outlaw, an iconic small-town sheriff, and the record-setting drug bust that ensnared them both.</p>



<p>Host Rob D&#8217;Amico transports listeners back to the opening salvos of the War on Drugs, when Mexican cartels were first emerging as blood-soaked mega-corporations, the U.S. government was engaging in draconian narcotics crackdowns, and there was so much dirty money swirling across the Rio Grande that even the most incorruptible citizen would be tempted.</p>



<p>The eight-episode series dissects how the interconnected communities of the border really work by diving deep into the complicated lives of the friends and enemies who have lived together there for decades. What emerges is a portrait not just of a corrupt cop and an unapologetic outlaw, but of an utterly unique community in the isolated and beautiful Big Bend region of Texas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“‘Witnessed: Borderlands’ is a timely series that offers a deep, fascinating, and action-packed look into the history of the War on Drugs, Mexican cartels, and a desolate region full of nonconformists,” said host Rob D’Amico. “Listeners will have the opportunity to truly experience these border communities through the larger-than-life characters covered in the podcast.”</p>



<p>“Witnessed: Borderlands” is produced by Eric Benson and David Waters at Campside Media. Julian Lynch, guitarist of acclaimed indie-rock band Real Estate, created an entire multi-composition original score for the podcast.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Podcast Examines Criminal Trial of Holmes, Disgraced Founder of Blood-Testing Technology Firm Theranos</strong></p>



<p><strong>Weekly Bonus Content “Bad Blood: This Week in Court” Available to Subscribers on Apple Podcasts Starting Monday 9/6</strong></p>



<p><strong>New York, NY – August 26, 2021 –</strong>&nbsp;“Bad Blood: The Final Chapter,” the new podcast from Three Uncanny Four Productions, in partnership with Sony Music Entertainment, examining the criminal trial of entrepreneur Elizabeth Holmes, premieres today. Hosted by John Carreyrou, Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative journalist who first exposed Holmes in 2015 and best-selling author (“Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup”), the new podcast will explore the rise and fall of Holmes and analyze larger questions about Silicon Valley’s business culture that the Theranos scandal raised. The first two episodes are&nbsp;<a href="https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapple.co%2Fbadblood&amp;data=04%7C01%7Candrea.fowler%40sonymusic.com%7Cad613d31e32a40a6052408d968830103%7Cf0aff3b791a54aaeaf71c63e1dda2049%7C0%7C0%7C637655734123665927%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=q5FTPSErieWjccSYlaOfLVn%2F3ADF9gM95gjDJN1AsRE%3D&amp;reserved=0">available now.</a></p>



<p>“Bad Blood: The Final Chapter” kicks off ahead of Holmes’ criminal trial, which begins August 31 in California. As Theranos’ leading expert, Carreyrou will give listeners a front row seat at the trial as it unfolds and provide insight into Holmes’ breathtaking story, her criminal defense, and the prosecution’s case. “Bad Blood: The Final Chapter” begins with an in-depth look at three of the trial’s biggest plot twists: Holmes’s pregnancy, her unusual and risky defense strategy; and the destruction of Theranos’s laboratory database.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’ve closely covered the Theranos saga for the past seven years dating back to when Elizabeth Holmes was hailed as the next Steve Jobs,” said host John Carreyrou. “Now with this podcast, I’m thrilled to put the entire story into context as Holmes finally faces justice for the fraud she allegedly perpetrated.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Episode 1: The Sympathy Play</strong><br>Elizabeth Holmes’s best chance of getting off is to win the jury’s sympathy. This episode explores the two ways she can do that. One is as a new mother who will have just given birth to a newborn. The other is by shifting as much of the blame as possible for what happened at Theranos to her ex-boyfriend, Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani, the blood-testing company’s former president and chief operating officer.</p>



<p><strong>Episode 2: Ebola<br></strong>Public health emergencies and the panic they stoke are breeding grounds for fraud. The COVID-19 pandemic made that glaringly obvious. And it led a lot of people to wonder: if Theranos was still around, would it have tried to capitalize on the global health crisis that’s claimed the lives of millions? Based on Holmes’ conduct during the 2014-2015 Ebola epidemic, the answer is likely yes. </p>



<p>Future episodes will focus on Balwani and Holmes’ relationship, Silicon Valley’s fake-it-til-you-make-it culture, never-before-heard conversations between Holmes’ and a&nbsp;<em>New Yorker</em>&nbsp;writer, the effect of Theranos’ testing inaccuracies on patients, and an analysis of the final verdict.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The series is produced by Lena Richards, Rahima Nasa and Jennifer Sigl at Three Uncanny Four. Emily Saul provides reporting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Listeners can follow the show on&nbsp;<a href="https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapple.co%2Fbadblood&amp;data=04%7C01%7Candrea.fowler%40sonymusic.com%7Cad613d31e32a40a6052408d968830103%7Cf0aff3b791a54aaeaf71c63e1dda2049%7C0%7C0%7C637655734123665927%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=q5FTPSErieWjccSYlaOfLVn%2F3ADF9gM95gjDJN1AsRE%3D&amp;reserved=0">Apple Podcasts</a>&nbsp;and all other major podcast platforms. Subscribers to “Bad Blood: The Final Chapter” on Apple Podcasts can tune in for weekly bonus episodes “Bad Blood: This Week In Court” starting 9/6. Each Monday, Carreyrou and other members of the Bad Blood reporting team will break down the events of the trial, providing listeners with expert analysis they won’t be able to find anywhere else.</p>

<p><b>ABOUT 2CELLOS <br /></b>2CELLOS is the eclectic, international sensation comprised of two classically trained cellists who reached video viral fame on YouTube from their 2011 rendition of <span class="xn-person">Michael Jackson&#8217;s</span> &#8220;Smooth Criminal.&#8221; The pair, Luka Šulić and HAUSER, have since created a name for themselves with their electric and dynamic playing style. Together, 2CELLOS have amassed a staggering 1.3 billion YouTube views, 5.5 million YouTube subscribers, 1 billion streams, and have sold nearly 1 million tickets. 2CELLOS have taken the cello to unimagined heights as their signature style breaks down the boundaries between genres of music, from classical and film music, to pop and rock. Known for their electric live performances, 2CELLOS have sold out shows across the globe at historic venues including <span class="xn-location">New York City&#8217;s</span> Radio City Music Hall, <span class="xn-location">London&#8217;s</span> <span class="xn-person">Royal Albert Hall</span> and the <span class="xn-location">Sydney</span> Opera House. The duo has performed alongside musical greats <span class="xn-person">Steven Tyler</span>, <span class="xn-person">Andrea Bocelli</span>, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Queens of the Stone Age and <span class="xn-person">George Michael</span>, to name a few, and was hand-picked by Sir <span class="xn-person">Elton John</span> to perform both as an opener as well as part of the iconic singer&#8217;s live band. 2CELLOS are celebrating their 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary this year, and are working hard to continue reaching new stratospheres. </p>

<p title="Theo Croker - State Of The Union 444 || BLK2THEFUTURE (Official Video) ft. Wyclef Jean"> </p>
</p></div>
<p><i>&#8220;I love the idea of taking it back to the future. The vibe of this song is just when we look at what has happened to us as a people, like literally in the past 40 years, and how history constantly keeps repeating itself &#8230; so this is like a cry of the youth, but it&#8217;s a different kind of cry &#8211; we&#8217;ve heard cries of freedom. We&#8217;ve cried for freedom so many times, and we&#8217;ve sung &#8220;we shall overcome&#8221; so many times, but we still don&#8217;t see things overcoming. So, this is like the youth &#8211; when you hear Theo hitting those horns, and you hear that track &#8211; it&#8217;s a revolution. And this revolution, unlike the other revolution, this one has been televised. And it&#8217;s been televised through every social outlet in the world. The idea of oppression, the idea of equal rights, the idea of &#8220;when are we gonna really get justice?&#8221; The idea of what real human rights is&#8230; but at the same time, keep in mind, this is <span class="xn-person">Theo Croker</span> and Wyclef Jean &#8211; so we gotta keep it sexy at the same time. We&#8217;re gonna make y&#8217;all think, but we&#8217;re also gonna make y&#8217;all move. Just to say we celebrate our ancestors. At the end of the video, I start to speak Creole, and you&#8217;ll feel that energy when we start to turn the whole thing into a celebration and into a movement.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>A contemporary oratorio, the 13 tracks that make <i>BLK2LIFE || A FUTURE PAST</i> are inspired by the forgotten hero&#8217;s journey towards self-actualization within the universal origins of blackness. It&#8217;s a sonic celebration of Afro-origin, and ultimately a reclamation of the culture, for the culture. <i>&#8220;Our hero receives a transmission from his ancestors while in meditation that sets him on a mission to raise the planet&#8217;s vibrations through music that defies the confines of a &#8216;genre&#8217; and frees the culture from the imminent threat of commercial gentrification,&#8221; </i>says Theo.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Written in the solitude of his childhood home in <span class="xn-location">Leesburg, Florida</span>, during the pandemic much of the album was informed by psilocybin meditations and astral travels. By retreating inward, Theo extracted a universal story with major implications and spiritual resonances.&nbsp; <i>&#8220;In the beginning, the universe was birthed out of a black hole,&#8221;</i> he says. <i>&#8220;Everything came from blackness.&nbsp; Black is every color combined.&nbsp; So, all cultures are full of this rich blackness.&nbsp; It isn&#8217;t a racial statement; it&#8217;s about understanding and accepting that this is not a new cultural phenomenon or new science, that we can reclaim our origins, traditions, and culture to better the future. I&#8217;m making a statement with the title and project, &#8216;I can be an artist first before I am a black artist&#8217;. I can be a musician, creator, and producer without category.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Theo will hit the road in support of the new album starting with a two-week residence at <span class="xn-location">San Francisco&#8217;s</span> Black Cat this August. Other dates will take him to select cities in the U.S. with more dates across the world &#8211; stops including <span class="xn-location">Oslo</span>, <span class="xn-location">Prague</span>, Milan, <span class="xn-location">Paris</span>, <span class="xn-location">London</span>, <span class="xn-location">Berlin</span>, and more &#8211; full tour schedule and ticketing info can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3251918-1&amp;h=260669401&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bandsintown.com%2Fa%2F1823630-theo-croker&amp;a=here" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>ABOUT <span class="xn-person">THEO CROKER</span><br /></b><span class="xn-person">Theo Croker</span> is a storyteller who speaks through his trumpet. A creative who refuses boundaries, the GRAMMY<sup>®&#xfe0f;</sup> Award-nominated artist, composer, producer, thought leader, and influencer projects his voice through the music. After seven years of sojourn in <span class="xn-location">Shanghai</span>, Croker crash-landed with a simmering original sound on the 2014 Dee Dee Bridgewater-assisted album <i>Afro Physicist</i>. Following the success of <i>Escape Velocity</i> in 2016, he ascended to a new stratosphere with <i><span class="xn-person">Star People Nation</span></i>&nbsp;in 2019. The record garnered a nomination in the category of &#8220;Best Contemporary Instrumental Album&#8221; at the 62nd GRAMMY<sup>®&#xfe0f;</sup> Awards. It attracted widespread critical acclaim including <i>Stereogum, Paste,</i>&nbsp;and <i>The <span class="xn-org">New York Times</span></i> who called it &#8220;an album that gallivants from swirling, left-field hip-hop beats to propellant swing to entrancing passages of African percussion. Through it all, Croker&#8217;s understated trumpet playing holds his small band together with swagger and poise.&#8221; Along the way, he also lent his sound to platinum-selling albums by everyone from J. Cole to <span class="xn-person">Ari Lennox</span> while touring his band across the globe many times over. In 2020, he hunkered down at his childhood home in the midst of the global pandemic and wrote his sixth full-length album, <i>BLK2LIFE || A FUTURE PAST,</i> releasing <span class="xn-chron">September 24</span><sup>th</sup> via Sony Music Masterworks. </p>

<p><b>See attached for proclamation. </b></p>
<p>Sony Music Entertainment, the parent company for Columbia Records and Legacy Recordings divisions, have endowed a bench in Tony&#8217;s name in Central Park, his most cherished spot in his hometown of NYC.&nbsp; &#8220;Sony Music wishes <span class="xn-person">Tony Bennett</span> the happiest of birthdays as he turns 95,&#8221; said <span class="xn-person">Richard Story</span>, President of Sony Music Entertainment&#8217;s Commercial Music Group.&nbsp; &#8220;Tony is an American treasure who became an international phenomenon and has chronicled his lifelong love affair with <span class="xn-location">New York City</span> in his music and his paintings.&nbsp; It is an honor to dedicate this bench to Tony in his beloved Central Park, where he has experienced so much joy and inspiration across the years.&#8221;<i>&nbsp;</i>The Adopt-A-Bench program supports the Central Park Conservancy, the nonprofit that manages and cares for Central Park.</p>
<p>Bennett continues to visit the park regularly and has sketched and painted the landmark&#8217;s surroundings in over 70 pieces of original artwork.&nbsp; The bench endowed in Tony&#8217;s honor is located at the east side of Center Drive when entering the Park at Central Park South and 6<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Avenue and displays a plaque.</p>
<p>Celebrated friends including <span class="xn-person">Alec Baldwin</span>, <span class="xn-person">Robert DeNiro</span> and <span class="xn-person">Keith Richards</span> sent birthday wishes that are up on Bennett&#8217;s socials now and more will be posting birthday wishes to the 19-time Grammy winner throughout the day. Tony will be preforming at the opening night of ONE MORE TIME: AN EVENING WITH TONY BENNETT AND LADY GAGA at Radio City Music Hall.&nbsp; The two-night engagement, tonight and <span class="xn-chron">August 5</span><sup>th</sup>, will mark Tony&#8217;s last live concert appearance in <span class="xn-location">New York City</span>. The shows sold out shortly after they went on sale to the public last week. </p>

<p><span>The news arrives on the heels of their latest single releases, &#8220;<a target="_blank" href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3237370-1&amp;h=2748568765&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DJ1JFt-db-0M&amp;a=Demons" rel="nofollow noopener">Demons</a>,&#8221; a haunting version of the Imagine Dragons&#8217; hit song, and &#8220;<a target="_blank" href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3237370-1&amp;h=2767520978&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DVvqImsjpfPo&amp;a=Livin%27+on+a+Prayer" rel="nofollow noopener">Livin&#8217; on a Prayer</a>,&#8221; a vibrant rendition of the Bon Jovi rock classic. Following a brief hiatus for 2CELLOS, where they each took some time to reflect on their accomplishments and relax, the duo linked up again in the studio amidst the 2020 global pandemic to reimagine the pop anthems and timeless rock staples that encompass the ten tracks on their forthcoming album, <i>Dedicated.</i> The arrangement process relied on a combination of gut instinct and intense study, practice, and transposition as the duo recharged instantly recognizable by everyone from Billie Eilish to Guns N&#8217; Roses. </span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Breaks are good for reflection,&#8221; says HAUSER of their new album. &#8220;You look back on all you&#8217;ve done so far and which direction you want to take for the future. We were traveling so much that we never had this kind of time for reflection. Everything is so much clearer.&#8221; Šulić adds, &#8220;We always planned to come back, and we came into <i>Dedicated </i>with a fresh approach and energy. We haven&#8217;t been on stage for two years now, so we can&#8217;t wait to get back out!&#8221; </span></p>
<p><i><span>Dedicated</span></i><span> finds 2CELLOS exploring a diverse catalog with their signature boundary-breaking playing style.

<p><span>&#8220;When you listen to us, we hope you realize the cello is a versatile and diverse instrument capable of playing the hardest rock, the softest ballad, and the most contemporary of music,&#8221; HAUSER concludes. &#8220;It moves you in a way that&#8217;s equally powerful. It has a whole palette of emotions, ups, and downs. We&#8217;re trying to give you an experience you can&#8217;t get anywhere else.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><b><span>ABOUT 2CELLOS<br /></span></b><span>2CELLOS is the eclectic, international sensation comprised of two classically trained cellists who reached video viral fame on YouTube from their 2011 rendition of <span class="xn-person">Michael Jackson&#8217;s</span> &#8220;Smooth Criminal.&#8221; The pair, Luka Šulić and HAUSER, have since created a name for themselves with their electric and dynamic playing style.

<p><strong><em>Podcast Series Sheds Light on the Mastermind behind the Horrific Los Angeles Fires in the 1980s and the 1990s</em></strong></p>



<p><strong><em>First Two Episodes Are Available Today</em></strong></p>



<p><strong>New York, NY – July 21, 2021 – </strong>Truth Media, in partnership with Sony Music Entertainment, announced today the premiere of its new podcast <em>Firebug</em>, examining the incredible truth behind a serial arsonist in Southern California in the early 1990s<strong><em>.</em></strong> Hosted by Academy Award-winning documentarian and founder of Crime Story Media Kary Antholis, <em>Firebug</em> explores the complex story of how a manuscript for a novel circulating throughout Hollywood helped reveal the true origins behind catastrophic fires blazing through Los Angeles. The first two episodes are <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/firebug/id1575788216" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">available today</a>. </p>



<p>For ten years, a serial arsonist, also known as a firebug, terrorized Southern California, burning down businesses in broad daylight and setting whole neighborhoods ablaze. Four people died. Then a manuscript called “Points of Origin” circulated around Hollywood, telling the story of a fictional arson investigator on the trail for a serial arsonist. The fires described in that manuscript looked a lot like the fires that had been set across Southern California, leading investigators down a path to discover if “Points of Origin” was truly a work of fiction or the confessions of a prolific arsonist and murderer. Using cinematic sound design, combined with archival and newfound footage, <em>Firebug</em> invites listeners to join Antholis as he journeys to figure out where fiction meets reality.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;I have lived with this story for three decades, and I am immensely grateful to the teams at Truth Media and Sony Music Entertainment for making it possible for me to tell it in such an impactful way,” Antholis said.</p>



<p><em>Firebug </em>is executive produced and edited by Emmy Award winning and Academy Award nominated storyteller, filmmaker, podcaster and pioneer Marc Smerling at Truth Media.</p>



<p>To listen to the first two episodes, please click the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/firebug/id1575788216" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. <strong> </strong> Listeners can subscribe to <em>Firebug </em>on all major podcast platforms, including Apple Podcasts, Spotify and Stitcher. Subscribe to <em>Firebug: Uninterrupted </em>on Apple Podcasts for ad-free listening. For more information on <em>Firebug </em>and all other Sony Podcast shows, follow @SonyPodcasts.</p>

<p>HR news outlet <strong>HRD Connect</strong> spoke in-depth to the Co-Chairs of Sony Music UK’s Social Justice Fund — Damaris Rex Taylor, Dorothy Hui, and Charlotte Edgeworth — about how our UK company seeks to support social justice in the country, sharing progress and initiatives since the fund’s launch in June 2020. </p>



<p>The article outlines that the fund has so far contributed around $25 million to more than 300 organisations championing anti-racist initiatives, and explores how <a href="https://www.sonymusic.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony Music UK</a> found new ways to support charity partners’ work during lockdown.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Charlotte Edgeworth, Sony Music&#8217;s Director of D&amp;I and Social Impact, says “Like any new entity, we are learning and developing as we&nbsp;go along. We look for&nbsp;charities doing&nbsp;great work in our key areas and work with them to identify how we can maximise our impact.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whilst the piece recognises that it’s still early days, it notes that the incredible work the Social Justice Fund partners are doing is already being seen and that Sony Music UK will continue to help address stereotypes and injustices faced by communities of colour. </p>

<p><strong><em>Feature Length Knebworth Documentary in Cinemas Worldwide from Thursday, 23rd September</em></strong></p>



<p><strong><em>Celebrating the 25th Anniversary of Oasis Live at Knebworth Park</em></strong></p>



<p><strong><em>Tickets on Sale From Tuesday, 10th August</em></strong></p>



<p><strong><em>Sign-up for information at <a href="https://www.oasisknebworth1996.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">www.oasisknebworth1996.com</a></em></strong></p>



<p>Oasis have today unveiled the title, release date and ticketing details for their eagerly anticipated Knebworth cinematic documentary, <em>Oasis Knebworth 1996</em>. After almost two years without significant live events anywhere in the world, the cinematic release of Oasis Knebworth 1996on 23rd Septemberwill serve as a timely reminder to fans new and old of the euphoria and togetherness that only a great concert can bring. <em>Oasis Knebworth 1996</em> is the story of the special relationship between Oasis and their fans that made the largest concert of the ‘90’s possible. It is told entirely in the moment through the eyes of the fans who were there, built around extensive, and never before seen archive concert and backstage footage from the event, with additional interviews with the band and concert organisers. Directed by Grammy Award-winner Jake Scott, this is a joyful and at times poignant cinematic celebration of one of the most iconic live concert events of the last 25 years, driven entirely by the music, and the fans&#8217; own experiences of that monumental weekend. Tickets for <em>Oasis Knebworth 1996</em> will go on sale on Tuesday 10th August, marking the 25 years to the day since the first night of the concerts.</p>



<p>Oasis’ two record breaking nights at Knebworth took place on 10th &amp; 11th August 1996, with over a quarter of a million young music fans from all over the world converging on Knebworth Park, Hertfordshire to see the legendary sets. Tickets went on sale on 11th May 1996. Queues formed outside local record shops and ticket offices overnight, and fans around the world spent the day on their landline phones trying to get through to constantly engaged booking lines. All tickets sold out in less than 24 hours, breaking every UK box office record in the process. Organisers estimated the band could have sold two or three times as many tickets. Over 2% of the population of the UK had attempted to buy tickets.</p>



<p>The monumental shows were set against a backdrop of the UK slowly recovering from a decade of recession. Emerging from the ‘80s, the mood of the nation was changing. A cultural resurgence in arts and culture was giving rise to Cool Britannia and, in their meteoric rise, Oasis embodied that new found optimism and swagger. Two short years had taken the band from their council estate in Manchester to becoming one of the biggest bands in the world and for the congregated masses, seeing themselves in the five men on stage in front of them, anything felt possible. Featuring a setlist absolutely packed from beginning to end with stone cold classics, from the opening salvo of <em>‘Columbia’</em> and <em>‘Acquiesce’, </em>all the way to<em> ‘Champagne Supernova’, ‘Don’t Look Back In Anger’</em>, <em>‘Live Forever’,</em> a triumphant, orchestra backed <em>‘I Am The Walrus’</em>, and the first song from the 1990s to cross one billion streams on Spotify, <em>‘Wonderwall</em>,’ the Knebworth concerts were both the pinnacle of the band’s success and the landmark gathering for a generation.</p>



<p>The film will be produced by Black Dog Films. Noel Gallagher and Liam Gallagher will serve as executive producers. It will be financed and distributed by Sony Music Entertainment and released theatrically by Trafalgar Releasing.</p>



<p>Liam Gallagher says <em>“Knebworth fo</em><em>​</em><em>r me was the Woodstock of the 90’s. It was all about the music and the people. I can’t remember much about it, but I’ll never forget it. It was Biblical.”</em></p>



<p>Noel Gallagher says “<em>I can’t believe we never played Rock ‘n’ Roll Star!”</em></p>



<p>Tom Mackay, President, Premium Content, Sony Music Entertainment says, <em>“We are thrilled to be working with RSA Films and Trafalgar Releasing to bring global audiences an incredible cinematic experience around one of Oasis’s most historic concerts.&nbsp; The premiere of Oasis Knebworth 1996 invites generations of fans who weren’t able to attend this iconic show to experience the lasting energy and impact around Oasis’ performance that truly rocked Knebworth 25 years ago.”</em></p>



<p>Trafalgar Releasing’s Marc Allenby says: &#8220;<em>The success and continuing legacy of Oasis defined a generation in a way few bands have throughout music history. We are proud to be bringing this celebratory film to cinemas in this special event release, bringing together audiences from all around the world to commemorate the 25th anniversary of these landmark gigs</em>.&#8221;</p>

<p><em><strong>New artists to benefit from full service approach, with Dua Anak Deo providing management support and Sony Music Indonesia providing global promotion and distribution expertise</strong></em></p>



<p><em><strong>Indonesian Idol star DNANDA announced as first artist under the new partnership</strong></em></p>



<p><strong>Jakarta, 30<sup>th</sup> June, 2021</strong> – Sony Music Entertainment Indonesia (SMEI) and Dua Anak Deo (DAD), an artist management company, announced today a new and exclusive partnership to bring new talent to the Indonesian music scene. This partnership unites SME with Indonesian music artist Judika, who launched DAD in 2016.</p>



<p>Through the new partnership, artists will benefit from DAD’s track record discovering talent and providing day-to-day management support and SMEI will harness its global expertise to record, promote and distribute their music to a nationwide audience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first artist signed to the new SMEI/DAD partnership is Dnanda Anugerah Pratama, also known as DNANDA, who starred in the Indonesian Idol Special Season 2021. His single “Tak Sekedar Cinta” was released on March 26 across multiple music streaming platforms.</p>



<p>“We’re delighted to be working with Judika who is truly one of the SMEI’s success stories”, said <strong>Muhammad Soufan, General Manager of Sony Music Entertainment Indonesia</strong>. “Over the past five years, Judika has turned DAD into an exciting and dynamic company, and we look forward to helping him take it to the next level by bringing a host of new and exciting talent to the Indonesian music scene.”</p>



<p>“Everyone at DAD is immensely excited about our new partnership with Sony Music Indonesia, a company known for being artist-centric in everything it does,” <strong>added Judika</strong>. “Our aim is to discover and launch the next wave of Indonesian talent, and working with Sony Music is key to bringing in new talent and accelerating our growth and reach across the country.”</p>



<p>Judika is no stranger to the Indonesian music scene. His music career took off after appearing in the 2005 series of Indonesian Idol. Since then, he has released a number of singles, albums, and music videos generating millions of streams, as well as winning numerous music awards in Asia.</p>



<p>Judika founded DAD to ensure he had the dedicated management and operational support needed to succeed in the Indonesian music industry. Since then, after building up over half a decade of expertise, Judika’s ambition is to take DAD to the next level by opening up the artist management company to more artists and harnessing the global industry expertise of Sony Music.</p>

<p><strong><em>Partnership follows successful collaborations in the past year including groundbreaking Lil Nas X Virtual Concert and Zara Larsson Launch Party.</em></strong></p>



<p><strong>SAN MATEO, Calif.&nbsp;</strong>—<strong>&nbsp;July 6, 2021</strong>&nbsp;—&nbsp;<a href="https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcorp.roblox.com%2F&amp;data=04%7C01%7Candrea.fowler%40sonymusic.com%7Cd5dd4fe78e3b4247160a08d94078c5aa%7Cf0aff3b791a54aaeaf71c63e1dda2049%7C0%7C0%7C637611709717907859%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=CI61P%2BJghHphUEvNuPuUaUfAvi%2FVYZhNmg0FFLiWDNg%3D&amp;reserved=0">Roblox</a>&nbsp;(NYSE: RBLX), a global platform bringing millions of people together through shared experiences, and Sony Music Entertainment, today announced a strategic partnership that will bring more Sony Music recording artists into the Roblox metaverse.</p>



<p>Under the agreement, Roblox and Sony Music will work together to develop innovative music experiences for the Roblox community that offer a range of new commercial opportunities for Sony Music artists to reach new audiences and generate new revenue streams around virtual entertainment.</p>



<p>The agreement builds on an existing relationship between the two companies that includes previous collaborations such as Lil Nas X’s hit virtual performance on Roblox in November 2020 and more recently the Zara Larsson Launch Party on Roblox in May 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over 36 million people watched Lil Nas X perform the first ever live virtual concert on Roblox, which included the debut of his hit song, Holiday. In addition the concert venue included virtual merchandise sales, mini-games, a scavenger hunt, an exclusive behind the scenes interview with Lil Nas X, and other interactive activities. Zara Larsson’s launch party broke records as well, attracting over four million visits, the highest recorded visits for a launch party on Roblox to date. The Dance Party took place in and around a virtual rendering of Zara’s Swedish lake house and featured mini games, interactive challenges, and exclusive virtual merchandise sales.</p>



<p>“Sony Music has been a fantastic partner and I am pleased to deepen and lengthen our relationship. They truly understand the massive opportunity that the metaverse presents for their artists and we are committed to helping them unlock new creative and commercial opportunities on Roblox,” said Jon Vlassopulos, Vice President and Global Head of Music, Roblox. “We are just scratching the surface of what Roblox can deliver to the music industry and to music fans around the world.”</p>



<p>Said Dennis Kooker, President, Global Digital Business and U.S. Sales, Sony Music Entertainment, “Sony Music artists have been at the forefront of engaging the millions of music fans in Roblox’s massive user community with forward-looking initiatives like Lil Nas X’s industry-first virtual performance on the platform, and Zara Larsson’s recent listening party event. With this new agreement, we look forward to expanding our successful partnership with the Roblox team to further unlock commercial opportunities at the intersection of music and gaming. Immersive online environments represent a meaningful opportunity for reaching a growing number of fans who want to use virtual communities to enjoy shared music experiences.”</p>



<p>The billions of hours people around the world spend on Roblox every month provides a perfect opportunity for the new generation of music fans to discover, share, and get closer to music and artists they love.&nbsp;For artists, labels, and publishers, Roblox provides a unique and creative way to engage and attract millions of fans as well as drive new revenue streams through virtual launch parties and concerts, integrated in-experience music, persistent artist worlds, and virtual merchandise. Roblox respects the rights of all creators and uses advanced technology to screen all uploaded music. Roblox has no tolerance for repeat offenders and quickly responds to all submitted DMCA requests.</p>

<p>This Pride month and year-round, Sony Music Group (SMG) is a proud advocate for LGBTQ+ equality, visibility, and rights — at our company and across the globe. Through our Global Social Justice Fund, SMG intentionally supports grassroots organizations focused on addressing localized issues and promoting racial and LGBTQ+ equality around the world. These grassroots organizations work at a community-level to identify challenges and help develop and implement sustainable solutions.</p>



<p>In recognition of PRIDE month, SMG sat down with some of the organizations we’ve supported through the Global Social Justice Fund to learn more about how they’re uplifting and advancing LGBTQ+ communities</p>



<p><a href="https://www.blackandpink.org/DONATE/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Black &amp; Pink</strong></a>&nbsp;is on a mission to end anti-LGBTQIA2S+ violence, medical racism, and eradicate all carceral systems. Uniting LGBTQIA2S+ prisoners and “free world” allies, the organization works toward abolishing the criminal punishment system. Black &amp; Pink shared some of the unconscionable stats motivating their work: People living with HIV are five to seven times more likely to be incarcerated than the general population, and 85% of LGBTQ+ people experience solitary confinement. Black &amp; Pink gives current and formerly incarcerated people access to resources they need to be healthy, safe, and happy within their communities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sony Music Group is also proud to partner with the&nbsp;<a href="https://transgenderlawcenter.org/donate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Transgender Law Center</strong></a>&nbsp;(TLC). TLC shared information and data about ongoing attacks, harassment, and discrimination faced by the global trans community—with Black and Brown trans people facing a disproportionate violence — in addition to inadequate&nbsp; access to basic necessities. Most recently, TLC conducted a report on the&nbsp;<a href="https://transgenderlawcenter.org/regional-reports" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roots of Anti-Trans Violence</a>&nbsp;to identify the root causes of anti-trans violence and found institutions – such as the government, ICE, the police – trap trans people into a life where they are vulnerable to homicide. These are systemic and institutional issues. Understanding that trans leaders and their communities know their own needs, TLC offers trans individuals leadership development, narrative change, and movement building programs, alongside cutting-edge litigation, and advocacy strategies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>David Johns from the&nbsp;<a href="https://nbjc.org/nbjc-donate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>National Black Justice Coalition</strong></a>&nbsp;(NBJC) shared how the organization focuses on federal policy to strive for racial equity and LGBTQ+ equality. Since 2003, NBJC has been dedicated to ending racism, homophobia, and LGBTQ+/SGL(same gender loving) bias and stigma. NBJC supports Black individuals, families, and communities; calls for change in conversations with political leaders; and supports peaceful protests for equal rights and opportunities for building collective power—all helping to usher in a new era of awareness and opportunity in the global movement for Black lives.&nbsp;</p>

TAC empowers the creative community and fans worldwide to be engaged allies. During tours with high profile musicians, through social media campaigns, and via collaborative partnerships, TAC supports and champions organizations serving LGBTQ youth around the world.

The new season explores Prince’s career in 2010-2011, as the artist recorded his prescient and political album <em>Welcome 2 America</em> and then mysteriously archived it and will offer listeners the first chance to hear the songs on the album ahead of its official release.</p>

The hosts will be joined by the additional musicians who performed on&nbsp;<em>Welcome 2&nbsp;</em>America—Tal Wilkenfeld, Chris Coleman, Elisa Fiorillo, and Liv Warfield—plus important behind-the-scenes collaborators from the era who will shed light on Prince’s creative process and late-night conversations.</p>



<p>In addition to hearing the stories behind the singles “Welcome 2 America” and “Born 2 Die,” listeners will get the opportunity to hear numerous unreleased vault tracks including “Same Page, Different Book,” “Check the Record,” “1000 Light Years From Here,” “1010 (Rin Tin Tin)” and “Stand Up and B Strong” for the very first time.</p>

<p>Under the agreement,Alamo, including its existing roster and catalog, will become a new frontline creative center within SME. The Company will continue to sign, develop and market its own roster of artists under the leadership of Moscowitz as CEO.</p>



<p>In making the announcement, Rob Stringer, Chairman, Sony Music Group said, “We are very excited to bring Todd and his label, Alamo, to our company. He has always been a visionary in an area of music that is now front and center of pop culture globally so we are delighted to add his experience and expertise to our creative strategy. We welcome him, his artists and his team to Sony Music and will provide all the partnership he needs to take the label to even greater heights.”</p>



<p>Since its founding in 2016, Alamo has quickly earned industry-wide recognition as a home to some of today&#8217;s most exciting new artists. The label has already brought numerous up-and-coming artists to the forefront, including Blackbear, Lil Durk and Rod Wave, who are helping to redefine the pop and hip hop genres for fans around the world. Lil Durk and Rod Wave have each scored their first #1 albums on the Billboard 200 this year with “The Voice of the Heroes” and “SoulFly,” respectively.</p>



<p>Said Moscowitz, Founder and CEO of Alamo Records, “I decided to partner with Sony Music because Rob and the team showed their deep understanding of entrepreneurship. Being competitive in this marketplace requires being fluid, fast and innovative and I have tremendous confidence that Alamo and our artists will get the support from Sony Music to take our entire company to the next level.&#8221;</p>



<p>A renowned music executive, successful artist manager and proven hitmaker, Moscowitz over his career has worked with artists including Common, Young Thug, Fetty Wap and Gucci Mane.

<p>The ten-episode series takes listeners behind the scenes to understand how Rama built up a massive loyal following in the 80s and 90s as a practicing Buddhist teacher and lecturer. The podcast explores the pull of teachers and gurus and specifically why Rama’s teachings struck a powerful chord in so many people. Much like season one of “Smoke Screen,” “I Am Rama” is full of new discoveries and unsolved mysteries — this time, behind the story of Rama and his students.</p>



<p>“This is, of course, a story that I am invested in personally, because of my family’s connection to Rama,” said Hirsch. “But it’s much more than that; as a documentarian, I am fascinated by the many mysteries that still linger years after Rama’s death. I’ve been surprised and captivated by how different the story of Rama and his students ended up being, as I learned more about who he was. I am excited to take listeners on this winding, eye-opening journey for the first time.”</p>

Neon Hum’s Executive Editor is Catherine Saint Louis.  Listeners can subscribe to “Smoke Screen: I Am Rama” on all major podcast platforms, including Apple Podcasts, Spotify and Stitcher.
