Their unique sound, influenced by their Latin roots and West Coast upbringing, was built on a movement rooted in true authenticity: from cultivating the flower, to smoking it, to rapping about it, their influence is forever burned into the musical landscape of Hip Hop as they continue to stay relevant after 30 years. Using a treasure trove of never-before-seen archival footage captured by Oriol himself, as well as images of band members B Real, DJ Muggs, Sen Dog and Eric \u201cBobo\u201d Correa,&nbsp;<em>CYPRESS HILL:<\/em>&nbsp;<em>INSANE IN THE BRAIN<\/em>&nbsp;tells the story of a brotherhood that has withstood the test of time to create a truly original, everlasting legacy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>CYPRESS HILL:<\/em>&nbsp;<em>INSANE IN THE BRAIN<\/em>&nbsp;is produced by Sony Music Entertainment and Mass Appeal for SHOWTIME.

With one foot firmly grounded in the outlaw life and the other as an activist and spiritual advisor, Lorine straddles the complexities of multiple worlds. Employing rich, never-before-seen archives of the borough that gifted the world both salsa and hip-hop culture, the documentary embarks on a complicated and, at times, surreal journey through five decades of Bronx history and resilience in La Madrina\u2019s own words.&nbsp;<em>LA MADRINA<\/em>&nbsp;is executive produced by Henry Chalfant (<em>Style Wars<\/em>) and Sacha Jenkins.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>BUSHWICK BILL: GETO BOY<\/em>&nbsp;chronicles the life of the late Richard Shaw, the Jamaican-American rapper and music producer professionally known as \u201cBushwick Bill,\u201d an original member of iconic, pioneering Houston rap group The Geto Boys.
