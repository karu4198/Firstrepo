The agreement also provides the opportunity for SME to partner with Dylan on additional projects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year marks the 60th anniversary of Bob Dylan\u2019s singular recording career. He was signed to SME\u2019s Columbia Records in October 1961 by the label\u2019s John Hammond and recorded his debut album that same year. His&nbsp;<em>Bob Dylan<\/em>&nbsp;album marked the start of an unparalleled musical journey by a master of music who continues to have a profound and global impact on culture.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bob Dylan said<\/strong>, \u201cColumbia Records and Rob Stringer have been nothing but good to me for many, many years and a whole lot of records. I\u2019m glad that all my recordings can stay where they belong.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In making the announcement,&nbsp;<strong>Rob Stringer, Chairman, Sony Music Group said<\/strong>, \u201cColumbia Records has had a special relationship with Bob Dylan from the beginning of his career and we are tremendously proud and excited to be continuing to grow and evolve our ongoing 60-year partnership. Bob is one of music\u2019s greatest icons and an artist of unrivaled genius. The essential impact he and his recordings continue to have on popular culture is second to none and we\u2019re thrilled he will now be a permanent member of the Sony Music family. We are excited to work with Bob and his team to find new ways to make his music available to his many fans today and to future generations.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bob Dylan is one of our culture\u2019s most influential and groundbreaking artists. In the decades since he first burst into the public\u2019s consciousness via New York City\u2019s Greenwich Village folk music scene in the early 1960s, Bob Dylan has sold more than 125 million records around the world and amassed a singular body of work that includes some of the greatest and most popular songs the world has ever known. He continues to traverse the globe each year, performing nearly 100 concerts annually in front of audiences who embrace his new music with the same fervor as they do his classics. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2016 \u2013 the first songwriter to receive such a distinction \u2013 cited by the Swedish Academy \u201cfor having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">May your song always be sung<br>And may you stay forever young<br> <br>Bob Dylan signed to Columbia Records in 1961 and today Sony Music announced it has fully acquired his entire catalog of recorded music, as well as the rights to multiple future new releases. <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/hdVaHGkuhi\">pic.twitter.com\/hdVaHGkuhi<\/a><\/p>&mdash; Sony Music News (@sonymusicnews) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/sonymusicnews\/status\/1485659382591410176?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 24, 2022<\/a><\/blockquote><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Expansion of Six-Decade Relationship Between SME and Dylan Includes Extension of Recording Agreement And Rights to Multiple Future New Releases NEW YORK, January 24, 2022 \u2014 Sony Music Entertainment (SME) today announced it has fully acquired Bob Dylan\u2019s entire back catalog of recorded music, as well as the rights to multiple future new releases, in [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":890,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[7],"tags":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v18.4.1 -
