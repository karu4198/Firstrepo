Designed to promote creativity, education and career development in the music industry, Beyond The Instrument focuses on STEAM programming and collaborates with community partners to inspire personal development and prepare future music leaders.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year\u2019s 2022 program will take place on March 31 with participation from Sony Music Latin artist Lupita Infante and students from Los Angeles Unified Griffith STEAM Magnet Middle School (LAUSD). Sony Music Entertainment\u2019s first event for the 2022 program will include a conversation with Infante led by artist, Nancy Sanchez, for students from the school to learn about Infante\u2019s journey to becoming a hit singer-songwriter. The program will be followed by a four-week series of music industry education workshops led by Music Forward with students from the Save The Music program.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As one of the program ambassador\u2019s this year, Latin Grammy\u00ae nominated artist Infante said, \u201cI am very honored to be part of Sony Music\u2019s Beyond The Instrument initiative and excited to share my experience within the beautiful world of music with the students. As a musician and performer, it is a privilege to help promote music education, and personally, working with LAUSD is very meaningful since my mom has worked with the district for over 30 years.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When speaking of the ongoing partnership, Towalame Austin, Executive Vice President, Philanthropy and Social Impact, Sony Music Group said, \u201cWe\u2019re honored to come together again with Music Forward and Save the Music to further develop music education programs and build opportunities for students in communities where STEAM education is underserved. Together with Lupita Infante, we look forward to proving these students with the resources they need and inspiring the next generation of music professionals.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to see and hear what happens when this group of students and these artists connect in the classroom,\u201d said Save The Music\u2019s Executive Director, Henry Donahue. \u201cLos Angeles has such a rich cultural history of amazing music, and we\u2019re fortunate to have Sony\u2019s support to bring instruments, technology, and teacher support to Griffith \u2013 part of Save The Music\u2019s drive to invest in more than 50 LA schools in the next few years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cMusic Forward is delighted to continue our partnership with Sony Music Group and Save The Music Foundation to help young people follow their dreams in music,\u201d said Nurit Siegel Smith, Executive Director, Music Forward Foundation. \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to contribute our educational programs, workshops, and resources to inspire the next generation of artists, leaders, and innovators.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cArts and music education expands the cognitive, social and emotional development of young people while helping to cultivate critical thinking and problem-solving skills that are important for a well-rounded education,\u201d said Los Angeles Unified Superintendent Alberto M. Carvalho. \u201cPartnerships with groups like Sony Music Group, Save The Music and Music Forward offer Los Angeles Unified the opportunity to infuse music into our curriculum. I am grateful that leaders within the music industry are giving their time to inspire the next generation of musicians.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most recently, Beyond The Instrument launched a collaboration with Sony Music Publishing and nonprofit organization, Girls Make Beats, to empower the next generation of female music producers, DJs, and audio engineers, as a part of the program\u2019s focus on songwriting and composing.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Annual Philanthropic Program is Designed to Provide Resources, Exposure and Direct Access to Music Professionals, Creatives and Executives Sony Music Latin Artist Lupita Infante to Lead Classroom Discussion for Los Angeles Unified Griffith STEAM Magnet Middle School NEW YORK \u2013 March 28, 2022 \u2013 Sony Music Group (SMG) today announced the continued collaboration between nonprofit [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":890,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[7],"tags":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v18.4.1 -
