By joining Ceremony of Roses\u2019 expertise in merchandising with SME\u2019s global reach, roster and resources, we are set up for an exciting new chapter of growth. CoR was founded with the goal of enabling and expanding authentic fan\/artist connections beyond a tour tee, and through working with incredible artists and mentors, especially Tyler, the Creator &amp; Christian Clancy, I have learned the value of fan engagement and the unique role merchandise and branding plays in this relationship. I look forward to helping the artists we work with build on the amazing advancements happening in the space today to deliver incredible experiences and products across all touchpoints with their fan base, regardless of where they are or how they buy.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This new partnership further builds on Sony Music\u2019s successful in-house merchandising business, and expands the scope and capabilities of its operations globally as part of the services and solutions it offers to the artist community.
