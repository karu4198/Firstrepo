The first episode is\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/podcasts.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/id1547265474\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">available now<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hosted by author Panama Jackson, the cofounder of the award-winning\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theroot.com\/very-smart-brothas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>VerySmartBrothas.com<\/em><\/a> website\u00a0and columnist at theGrio, the series will dive into\u00a0the life of the bombastic boxing promoter, whose\u00a0career highlights include the historic &#8220;The Rumble in the Jungle&#8221; and the &#8220;Thrilla in Manila&#8221; matches, and alliances with some of the biggest\u00a0cultural icons outside of the ring, including Michael Jackson and The Jackson Family. The first episode features Don Elbaum, the boxing promoter who helped Don King get his start and King\u2019s longtime attorney and friend, Clarence Rogers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>King has led a remarkable life, filled with defenders and detractors and the series will explore all aspects of his epic journey, from his formative years filled with adversity and crime to becoming the most successful boxing promoter the sport has ever seen, and the first Black man to achieve that status. While his larger-than-life appearance and commanding personality made him a star in and out of the ring, as did his promotion of greats like Muhammad Ali, Mike Tyson, Larry Holmes, Joe Frazier, King also faced accusations that his personal success was achieved by taking advantage of others. The series will feature new interviews with those closest to him, as well as cultural commentators who cover the cross section of race and culture in media.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Panama Jackson said, &#8220;Don King isn&#8217;t a complicated man. In reality, his goals were pretty simple: be the biggest, best promoter and showman ever and make A LOT of money doing it! To that end he was supremely successful. What is complicated though, is how that success\u2014and the legacy built from it\u2014looks in a historical context, which really depends on who you ask. He built an empire that made him rich but also made him look like a crook, but do you hate the player or hate the game? We&#8217;ll use this series to explore the nuance of that dichotomy; one that lives at the intersection of race, politics, sports and power resulting in Don King&#8217;s hold over boxing and culture in the 70s, 80s and 90s.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lizzie Jacobs and Tom Koenig are executive producers, Tiffany Walker is producer and associate producers are Kyre Assibey-Bonsu and India Witkin.
